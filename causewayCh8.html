<p class="skill"><span class="psy">BRAIN BOUNCER:</span> That's terrifying.</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="fys">SPEED DEMON N° 1111:</span> That's cool.</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="int">DATA COLLECTOR:</span> So, the amnesiac is some kind of expert on the Pale? </p>
<p>"You have an interest in entroponetics, Detective?" Kim asks, sidestepping the outlandish hypothesis. </p>
<p>"You don't think my theory is worth pursuing?" Harry counters, sidestepping the sidestep. </p>
<p>"No, I don't think 'The Pale made me do it' will hold up in a court of law," Kim says, looking back down at his notebook. </p>
<p>"The Pale will do worse before it's all over. You can count on that," Harry says. </p>
<p>Kim decides not to react to this prognostication. </p>
<p>"Well, I don't know how much you remember from your Pale-related reading, Detective, but there <em>are </em>a couple recorded cases of murder during psychosis induced by prolonged Pale exposure. However, those were committed by people with hundreds of hours of exposure—repeater workers, aerostatic pilots, paledrivers. I don't think that precedent applies to your case."</p>
<p>"But it could potentially apply in the murderer's case," Harry insists. "What about someone losing their sanity after living their whole life in l'émergence?" </p>
<p>"Lots of people live in or near the zone d'émergence for their entire lives," Kim says. "In the Semenine Islands, for instance, on Sereglee and Banaital." </p>
<p>Harry hmms thoughtfully. "I'll have to do more research."</p>
<p>"You won't," Kim says, "because you are not investigating this murder. Let's return to what you <em>are </em>investigating, which is your alibi. You slept. Tell me what times you remember."</p>
<p>"2:30-ish, 4:41, 5:10, 5:40, 6:00..."</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">COMPASSION:</span> He really sleeps badly. </p>
<p>"What time did you get up?" Kim asks. </p>
<p>"Around 7," Harry says. "I hate waking up in the dark."</p>
<p>"Did you leave your room?" </p>
<p>"Yes," Harry says, "I had breakfast with one of the other guests. He's an older ex-military guy. Valentin." </p>
<p>At that hour, Kim was already trekking north. "Until?" </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="mot">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> (challenging—success) He used to be really good at trivia. Now he sucks at it, and he's bitter about that. </p>
<p>"Went for a walk. I said hi to Henri on the way out, he'll remember, 'cause I annoy him. Then I went down to the bay and poked around on the beach for a while. 'Til noon. Plenty of fishermen down there probably saw me. Then I came back here and listened to some more radio in my room... Then I got arrested for murder. That was around 4 PM. Does that cover everything?"</p>
<p>Kim finishes filling in the chart. </p>
