        <em>One day earlier</em>
      </p>
      
      <p>OF THE QUESTIONS on Hermann’s mind, one was foremost: Where had Newt been traveling? What was his destination from King’s Cross Station, with the device in his pocket?</p>
      
      <p>In reality, Newt had just returned. A train had taken him north under the late morning sun, and another had returned him south by late, humid afternoon.</p>
      
      <p>He set out in the morning heat feeling, physically, much better. The transducer’s adverse effects had lessened ever since the dual test the night before. There was no more ringing, and his mind felt clearer than it had in days. Only the intermittent vertigo persisted. He was aiming for a simple goal of intelligence collection, propelled by claustrophobic restlessness and Hermann’s contagious anxiety. He had to do <em>something. </em>Did he need the device to do it? Both components? Probably not. But he brought them just in case. In all, he felt ready and able to ask the questions on his mind and to get some answers about the man on the margins of all this: the mysterious Raleigh Becket.</p>
      
      <p>His destination was Dr. Gottlieb’s alma mater, Cambridge University. When he disembarked, Cambridge Station was bustling with end-of-term travel. Though it was hot under the sun in Hermann’s oversized jacket, Newt found himself shivering. He narrowly avoided death by trunk trolley and stopped at a bench to count the money left in his pocket. Getting to the train station with no wallet had been tricky, and the round-trip ticket had nearly cleaned him out. Newt wasn’t sure whether Hermann had taken his wallet on purpose. It didn’t seem like him, so Newt was trying not to hold it against him. But Hermann was acting really paranoid.</p>
      
      <p>He didn’t have enough for any more cab fares. He thought wistfully of the Bonneville, still stranded at the Estate. Riding it at this point, though, probably would have been a challenge. The fact remained: he needed a lift.</p>
      
      <p>Newt asked a dazed-looking undergraduate for change outside the phone booth. Then he called the university, got himself transferred to St. Catharine’s, breezily lied to a secretary about having a personal appointment with the don. After another pause, a gravelly voice said:</p>
      
      <p>“Thurston, who’s this?”</p>
      
      <p>“Professor! It’s Newt Geiszler. I’m in town for the day. Might you be free sometime this afternoon?”</p>
      
      <p>“As it happens, I am,” said the ancient voice. “Are you on campus already, Newton?”</p>
      
      <p>“No,” said Newt. “Still at the station. Just arrived.”</p>
      
      <p>“Ah. Yes. Good. I’ll send somebody round.”</p>
      
      <p>“You aren’t still riding your bicycle, Professor?”</p>
      
      <p>“No, no, regrettably no,” said Thurston, with a heavy sigh like someone launching into a long story. “I’m afraid I really have become too old for it. My knees...”</p>
      
      <p>“That’s a shame.”</p>
      
      <p>“I’ll send one of my graduate students,” Thurston said, as if he didn’t hear Newt, which he may not have. “He’ll be there for you presently.” He rang off abruptly.</p>
      
      <p>After a long career in the secret services, Thurston had ‘retired’ to take a post at Cambridge. There he specialized in Old English literature and Germanic philology, while he continued his work as a talent-spotter. It was he who had first recruited the nervous young Hermann. Newt had met him a few times, and found the old professor both compelling and alien.</p>
      
      <p>“This must be the Thurston express,” Newt said a few minutes later as the unmistakable craft drew to a halt in front of the station. The student riding it, in shirtsleeves and wool pants, put a foot down and took off his sunglasses. Thurston’s famous bicycle was military-issue from WWII, and it looked fit to haul a cannon. Its detailing was painted eggshell blue. A wooden cart was frequently hitched behind, painted the same color. The venerable professor’s slow trips around the campus were well known. In his heyday, he had towed books and sometimes students in the cart behind.</p>
      
      <p>“I thought it was retired,” said Newt.</p>
      
      <p>“The professor said you requested it specifically,” said the student. He was not looking impressed by that.</p>
      
      <p>“Not as such,” said Newt, unable to conceal a laugh.</p>
      
      <p>“All the same, you’d better get in,” the student said, nodding to the cart. “He’s waiting for you. I don’t have a spare helmet. Sorry.” Newt climbed in and rode, facing backwards, to Cambridge University.</p>
      
      <p>The day was bright and full of birdsong, the wind pleasantly cool in the hot sun. The green and brick campus slipped by at a non-nauseating speed. It was here that Hermann had diverged from his academic path onto the unlikely path that led underground—underground both figuratively and literally, Newt reflected. He wondered, had Hermann ever taken a ride in the Thurstonmobile? He guessed not, but he spent an enjoyable moment picturing it. He thought of his own years in his own college, and didn’t miss it a bit.</p>
      
      <p>It occurred to Newt, as cars slowed down and passers-by turned to gawk, that this was perhaps the most conspicuous way to travel. An undergraduate whooped as he flew past.</p>
      
      <p align="center">*</p>
      
      <p>Professor Thurston was hugely large, as vast as his indeterminate age. He ushered Newt into his sitting room, walled with bookshelves of leather-bound Germanic titles, and asked another student to bring them tea. Newt politely sipped, feeling at home in the unrepentant plush-and-leather extravagance of academia.</p>
      
      <p>In his time working for the secret services, the venerable Thurston had been a “computer,” a person who archived and processed immense amounts of personnel data in his head. The electronic computers they had now were only just catching up with what Professor Thurston could do with his eyes closed. His memory was as vast as the Black Chamber’s archives. He knew every agent on each side by name. Everybody in the Division had known him, once; you could be sure that he knew you, too, even if you hadn’t met.</p>
      
      <p>It couldn’t be said that Thurston knew anyone particularly. He knew everyone like a curiosity. His memory was extraordinary, by far more extraordinary than Newt’s simple photographic memory—it was agile, it made connections, and it stretched back decades. While Newt’s archive was in ideas and concepts, Thurston’s was in people: their habits, their careers, their lives. But the thousands of lives in his head were still, to him, data points.</p>
      
      <p>Thurston settled down with his tea, wheezing as he lowered himself into an unwilling armchair. There was first some preamble about Thurston’s troubles, his unwilling students and the uncooperative department heads. He asked after all the employees of the radio lab whom he knew, including Hermann (whom he referred to as “your man”), and Newt reported their affairs and career trajectories faithfully. There was a moment of confusion when Thurston also asked after Augustus Westerby, and it took some clarification before Newt realized that he’d meant Wesley—an unexpected blip for the professor. Could it be that he was losing his gift, after all these years?</p>
      
      <p>“I don’t suppose you’ve just dropped by for tea and pleasantries, then, Newton?” Thurston finally said, setting his cup down and leaning back in his chair.</p>
      
      <p>“You suppose correctly, Professor,” said Newt, leaning forward in his.</p>
      
      <p>“What’s on your mind?”</p>
      
      <p>Newt opened his mouth, his well-ordered set of questions blowing away like a deck of cards in a brisk wind. The question that came out was:</p>
      
      <p>“What is Raleigh Becket’s problem?”</p>
      
      <p>Thurston made a thoughtful exhale that sounded like a winded racehorse. “Becket,” he said.</p>
      
      <p>“Raleigh Becket. He was probably still a runner when you last heard of him,” Newt said. “He’s risen in the ranks ever since our friend Bowen leveled the playing field—as it were, by blowing it to pieces.”</p>
      
      <p>Thurston didn’t respond. He looked unfocused, half-asleep. Newt wondered if he had traveled here in vain.</p>
      
      <p>“Ex-Marine,” Newt said, trying to jog his memory.</p>
      
      <p>“Mm,” said Thurston, eyes closing fully.</p>
      
      <p>Watching the professor, Newt wondered where your memories went when you could no longer access them. Did they vanish from existence? Or were they still stored in Thurston’s head someplace? Would they be, perhaps, accessible with the right tools? He had the device in his pocket and in his ear...</p>
      
      <p>“I think he served in the Middle East,” said Newt.</p>
      
      <p>“It was the Suez Crisis,” Thurston corrected conversationally, eyes still closed. “Becket may have been the only Englishman who came out of that looking well.”</p>
      
      <p>“What did he do?”</p>
      
      <p>“Timely information to his commander and shrewd advice, too, I’m guessing. It got him a transfer into the Division. As—”</p>
      
      <p>“And then he was posted to Berlin?”</p>
      
      <p>“Some time later, yes,” said Thurston. He opened his eyes. “Are you going to interrupt?”</p>
      
      <p>“No. Sorry.”</p>
      
      <p>“Why did you come to see me for this, rather than consult the record?” Thurston asked, picking up his teacup again, which looked minuscule in his gigantic hand.</p>
      
      <p>“I got a tip, of sorts. From Caitlin Lightcap.”</p>
      
      <p>“Ah, Miss Lightcap. Such an <em>interesting</em> choice for recruitment, I always thought. She’s still out in the cold, I assume?”</p>
      
      <p>“Very much so,” said Newt.</p>
      
      <p>“An extra-curricular tip, then. What was it she told you?”</p>
      
      <p>“Well, it actually started with… Wagner,” Newt said before he finished thinking about whether he should say it or not.</p>
      
      <p>“The Wagner Mission? Of ‘63? Or ‘34?”</p>
      
      <p>“’63,” said Newt reluctantly.</p>
      
      <p>He hadn’t really thought about how much he’d have to confide in Thurston to get this information. Was he still in touch with his old buddies? With the Chief? Newt wanted information from him, not the other way round. But whatever he said might make its way back to Century.</p>
      
      <p>In his pocket, he touched the little box that contained the transmitter.</p>
      
      <p>“I don’t know much about it,” Thurston said. “It was after my time.”</p>
      
      <p>“It’s Hermann, you know. He was on that mission. And he never told me about it. Traumatic experience, I guess. Well, he finally did. Tell me. About it. Recently. And after all of it, he never found out what happened to the device, right, the one Becket lifted—supposedly—from Wagner Airbase. So I decided to ask around a bit, see if I could figure out who took it—to put Hermann’s mind at ease, you know. I mean, the guy goes on <em>one </em>away mission and blames himself for the horrible outcome. How many of these operations turn out, anyway? Got to be less than 20 percent, I mean, it’s ridiculous. So I was talking about it with Lightcap, and she said—well, her note actually was about Rennie, not Raleigh. And I guess, I <em>guess</em> they could have been in cahoots, but that just doesn’t, I don’t know, it just doesn’t <em>fit</em> with what I know of Becket, so I thought—”</p>
      
      <p>“What was it she told you about Charles?”</p>
      
      <p>“Just that he and Victor were close,” said Newt, pulling the babbling up short.</p>
      
      <p>“Yes, certainly,” said Thurston, looking at him placidly. “They were involved for many years.”</p>
      
      <p>“Involved?” said Newt, taken aback. “Charles Rennie and Vice Chief Victor?”</p>
      
      <p>Thurston frowned at him. “Yes. Your man never told you?”</p>
      
      <p>“No! What? Do other people <em>know</em> about this?”</p>
      
      <p>“Not my business whether or not others know. Just my business to know it all, in case they come to ask. I suppose you never knew them, but yes, young man, they were <em>involved</em>, <em>lovers </em>if you’re feeling sentimental.”</p>
      
      <p>“But—” Newt’s mind was racing. How could he never have known? All these years? “But they’re so... different.”</p>
      
      <p>Thurston made a nonverbal noise and picked up his teacup.</p>
      
      <p>“How long were they together?” Newt persisted.</p>
      
      <p>“Forever. Until Charles died, as far as I know,” said Thurston.</p>
      
      <p>“And Hermann knows this? Why didn’t he ever tell me?”</p>
      
      <p>“I haven’t the slightest idea,” said Thurston, setting his cup down carefully. “But I believe you came to me about Mr. Becket, not ancient workplace gossip.”</p>
      
      <p>“I—er, yes,” said Newt, rubbing his jaw. The conversation was getting away from him. “Is it possible—” He ventured his working theory: “Did Becket and Rennie know each other well? Is it possible they were in cahoots?”</p>
      
      <p>Thurston considered. “It’s certainly possible.”</p>
      
      <p>“Would you say it’s likely that Rennie recruited Becket for one of his, you know, schemes? With his weapons-dealing friends?”</p>
      
      <p>“To steal the coveted <em>device</em>, for instance, and sell it to these weapons-dealing friends?”</p>
      
      <p>Newt shrugged. “For instance.”</p>
      
      <p>“It’s possible,” said Thurston. “It’s possible.”</p>
      
      <p>“But not likely,” said Newt, hearing his tone.</p>
      
      <p>Thurston was sipping his tea. He set the tiny cup down.</p>
      
      <p>“The crack of corruption went much deeper than Charles’s weapons-dealing friends,” he said. “To really understand it, you must understand his conspiracy with Robert. The weapons dealers, they were small fish by comparison. I believe Charles was working for the other side, along with Robert, for many, many years. Together, they deceived the whole service, and Victor most of all.</p>
      
      <p>“Now, Victor does not agree with my theory. He still believes Charles was another victim of Bowen’s betrayal. But these last ten years, I’ve given the problem much thought.” Thurston spoke of it as if it were a puzzle, a theorem whose solution eluded him. He raised his finger and traced a triangle in the air. “Victor, Bowen, Rennie.”</p>
      
      <p>“The holy trinity,” said Newt, with an irony that Thurston did not seem to notice.</p>
      
      <p>“But to truly make you understand, I ought to go back to the beginning,” he said.</p>
      
      <p align="center">*</p>
      
      <p>“Long before we discovered Robert Bowen, the Soviets recruited him. It was, we believe, early in his university studies. They recruited him as a deep cover agent, a mole. He was to build an illustrious career in English intelligence, gain power and access, and act on the Russians’ behalf every step of the way.</p>
      
      <p>“At the same time, Victor, who was a year ahead of him in his studies, was already a member of our early recruitment group at Oxford. Victor’s father was the youngest son of the Duke of Dodge. I wonder, what did young Victor think of his cousin, the duke-to-be, as they grew up together? Alfred was the boy’s name, I recall. How Victor must have hated him. By the time he got older, by the time he and I met, it was all a joke to him. The <em>title</em>—in <em>this</em> day and age, who would want such a thing? Victor was a soldier, a man of action! A man of action, like his friend Robert.</p>
      
      <p>“They didn’t meet until Robert’s second year, when he was finally recruited. In my estimation, Victor was vital to his rise. A person like Robert, who is hungry for power, they need acolytes. That’s exactly what Victor was.</p>
      
      <p>“Oh, when I met them, they were thick as thieves. Enchanted by Robert, Victor was. Everyone was, men and women. But Robert gave <em>Victor </em>the time of day, and that made him feel like the most important man in the network.</p>
      
      <p>“Now, I am no great judge of character. Not my purview, not my function. But there was always something cruel about Robert the charmer. He was always a philanderer—everybody knew about his dalliances in the secretary pool and among the coding bay girls. His attention, his approval was a wonderful thing. But a barb from him stung, and made you the more desperate to recover in his eyes. Even I felt it, unsentimental as I am.</p>
      
      <p>“Well, the war came and put an end to their studies. Robert and Victor were posted together in London for the first years of the war, and then separated. I believe Victor ended up in Spain. Robert was sent to Paris. He was superb. Partly, thanks to his discovery of young Charles. Do you know how they met?” Thurston asked, remembering there was another person in the room and opening his eyes. It was plain that this was where his interest and his expertise lay: in the glory days.</p>
      
      <p>Newt shook his head. “No.”</p>
      
      <p>“I quite like this story. It’s a few months into the posting, and Robert’s restless. He hears about this underground cafe still operating, where the opposition and the criminal element still drink and play cards. He thinks he’ll go down, play a few hands, make some friends, maybe win a few francs. Never was hesitant to mix business with pleasure. But he goes—he steps through the door, then there’s a shout and someone’s socked him in his jaw. He goes down, and two Frenchmen are on top of him, shouting about a debt, what a lot of gall he has showing his face here again. ‘But I’ve never been here before!’ he protests. They pull him up to his feet and take a look. ‘Why—you’re not who we thought you were,’ the Frenchmen say. ‘But my, you look so much alike! Are you sure you’re not a twin?’</p>
      
      <p>“Quite sure, Robert tells them, but with a little asking around, he finds his doppelgänger —running a check-and-telegram con on a German troop, no less—Mr. Charles Rennie.”</p>
      
      <p>Then Thurston said something else. Newt, coming back to himself, realized he had missed a sentence or two.</p>
      
      <p>“...steal the plans for an offensive on the southern flank...”</p>
      
      <p>“What? Sorry—could you repeat that?”</p>
      
      <p>Thurston blinked, disoriented by the interruption.</p>
      
      <p>“Repeat what?”</p>
      
      <p>“Just, whatever you just said.”</p>
      
      <p>The professor cleared his throat with consternation and said: “I was explaining the way they operated in Paris. Charles insinuated himself with one of the troops, as a dealer who could bring them contraband; one night, he brought them absinthe, and while they were all out of their minds, Robert walked right into their barracks. They took him for Charles, let him through the door, and he cleaned them out. Plans and code books and all.”</p>
      
      <p>Thurston raised his two index fingers, and crossed them demonstratively.</p>
      
      <p>“One replaces the other.”</p>
      
      <p>Newt laughed appreciatively, still feeling a little disoriented. He felt very warm.</p>
      
      <p>“Well, after the war, Victor joined them and the happy trio were posted to Istanbul. It was there that Charles and Victor took up together. Istanbul was a hotbed in those early postwar days—I’m sure you know the story of Victor’s broken jaw—”</p>
      
      <p>“I just don’t see it,” said Newt, unable not to interrupt. “The two of them? How did they get along? Did they even care about the same things? Victor’s so straight-laced, and Rennie is—was—a <em>crook</em>. Though, I guess Victor was different then. That’s what Hermann says. Was he?”</p>
      
      <p>“I really haven’t the slightest idea,” said Thurston, annoyed at the interruption.</p>
      
      <p>That, Newt thought with some frustration, could sum up your knowledge on the whole issue. Thurston really <em>was</em> a computer—it was all statistics to him.</p>
      
      <p>“But if I may,” he was resuming, “Istanbul. They collected plenty of good intelligence, the three of them. They set up some networks that are, I believe, still in use today. They were there for five years. Then, Robert was promoted to Swiss Head of Station—quite young for it, too—and posted in Berne. Rennie went along with him. Headquarters offered Victor a job in London, and he took it. Married his secretary. Settled down.”</p>
      
      <p>“Really?”</p>
      
      <p>“Newton, if it’s gossip you came for, I really can’t help you. During this period, I retired. I recruited your man, Gottlieb, with Victor’s help. In the late ‘50s, Bowen returned to London for promotion.”</p>
      
      <p>That must have been when Caitlin met him, Newt thought. Thurston said something else, and again, Newt had the curious sensation of the memory getting lost along the way. He felt sure he had heard it, but it hadn’t been recorded for storage.</p>
      
      <p>Newt shifted uneasily in his seat, to see if he still had control of his faculties. He did. He had the uncomfortable sensation that his body and mind were performing tasks, unsupervised.</p>
      
      <p>He touched his ear. No ringing. Maybe that silence was not a relief, but rather something to be wary of.</p>
      
      <p>“...and Victor got a divorce.” Thurston was saying. “Around this time, the Americans lodged their complaint about Bowen. That was when the net began to close around him.”</p>
      
      <p>“Yikes,” Newt murmured, a little distracted by his own unsteady thoughts.</p>
      
      <p>Another moment passed and disappeared. Then:</p>
      
      <p>“...they moved to arrest him quietly, but he’d already run off to the Estate. I know you know all of this, of course. But I’ll add in my own suspicion.”</p>
      
      <p>Here, Thurston sat forward. The professor’s voice grew sharper, straighter, like an arrow searching for its target. It drew Newt back to attention.</p>
      
      <p>“When Robert went missing, Headquarters sent out an emergency alert to all homeland stations. That included the Training Estate. A call was placed. According to Headquarters’ records, a call was placed. But no staff remembers any such call. In the inquiry, afterwards, everyone swore there was no call. And they were all fired, of course. In the final report, it was decided that Robert himself intercepted it.</p>
      
      <p>“But I believe that he had somebody on the inside, at the Estate. Somebody he trusted, who interfered with that message. Somebody who was never identified.”</p>
      
      <p>Thurston sat back again, straightening up. His intensity ebbed away—he seemed to be coming out of his trance. Newt, too, was feeling more lucid. Maybe the heat of the afternoon had been putting him to sleep.</p>
      
      <p>“Well, 36 hours later, he asks for a lift to the station, gets on the local train to Great Yarmouth, walks to the port, gets picked up by a Norwegian merchant, and sails off into the sunrise, as it were. To the great unknown East.</p>
      
      <p>“So that was it. Bowen was gone, Rennie was dead. And Victor swore revenge.”</p>
      
      <p>Newt nodded. “Revenge,” he repeated.</p>
      
      <p>“Do you think Bowen’s still alive?” he asked.</p>
      
      <p>“I do,” Thurston said, shifting and beginning to lift himself out of his chair. “He has the chops to make it even in Moscow.”</p>
      
      <p align="center">*</p>
      
      <p>After Newt went to the bathroom to splash some water on his face, he returned for the final questions. He had learned far more than he’d expected, about matters he had never really thought to question. The scale and scope of Bowen’s operation awed him, and his own muddled frame-up shrank to mere inconvenience in comparison. Yet things were making more sense, somehow—even if he didn’t have the answers he had wanted, his researcher’s intuition told him that he was in the right area, asking the right questions.</p>
      
      <p>“Where did Becket come from? What does he want?”</p>
      
      <p>“He was a bit after my time, but I can offer you the broad strokes of his career,” Thurston said. “American father, French mother, raised in England. He joined an elite force in the Royal Marines quite young, along with his older brother. His brother was tragically killed in a training accident. He was only 22.</p>
      
      <p>“After the Suez Crisis, young Raleigh came home from Egypt, discharged from the Marines, and went to the Estate to be trained. The Division’s newest bright star. I don’t know who fast-tracked him. He was quite young—hardly 23, as I recall.</p>
      
      <p>“From there, he was posted to Bonn, and then later West Berlin. That was a coveted position, at the time—dangerous posting, lots of excitement. In ‘63, Vice Chief Bowen sent him over the wall to East Berlin, to help Rennie. Then, the Bowen crisis broke, and his position was compromised.”</p>
      
      <p>“He vanished, didn’t he?”</p>
      
      <p>“Quite right. Along with every forward-thinking op in the field.”</p>
      
      <p>“He sure has a talent for surviving a crisis.”</p>
      
      <p>“Mr. Becket is an ambitious young man. He saw early that a career in the Marines would not give him the stature it once would have. Someone gave him an opportunity to jump ship, and he took it. He’s made a remarkable job of it already—he’s the Head of Station in Vienna before the age of 40. He has his eyes on the prize, as it were: Chief, or an intelligence minister.”</p>
      
      <p>And Newt was reminded of Thurston’s description of young Robert Bowen: <em>He was to build an illustrious career</em>. Was that where Newt’s theory had gone wrong? Was he not another Rennie, but another Robert Bowen?</p>
      
      <p>He bid goodbye to the professor and rode back to the station, conducted again in the bicycle cart but by a different student. Newt was thinking of Becket the <em>ambitious </em>young man: that was exactly the impression Newt had got from him on their trip to Langley together. It was, now that he thought of it, why he had never trusted Becket. It seemed so obvious now.</p>
      
      <p>But how could he have broken into the stables at the same time he was in the meeting?</p>
      
      <p>And why had he targeted Newt?</p>
      
      <p>In the bicycle cart, Newt watched the bricks and bikes flash by and thought of Hermann here. Not as a student, but as a professor. That was where Hermann really belonged, Newt thought, breathing in the spring wind. He belonged in a dusty, sunlit library, not in a damp, unlit basement where the mold aggravated his asthma. His discoveries deserved to see the light of day.</p>
      
      <p align="center">*</p>
      
      <p>On the train, the strange lethargy returned. Newt slouched low in the leather seat and for many stops, he remained unusually still. He reviewed all that Thurston had told him, focused intently on it, wanting to make sure he had remembered it all. But he found that his line of thought kept falling away from what he wanted to pursue, like he was a climber on a rope, descending into a canyon bit by bit. He wanted to stop, grip the rock face, climb back up a few inches and examine things, but the inexorable force of gravity kept on pulling him down.</p>
      
      <p>He descended into his memory, trying to work something out. Becket, the conference meeting schedule, the stable sign-in sheet.</p>
      
      <p>Becket had signed in at 8:20, out at 8:31, and then joined Victor and Rosewater for the meeting, until 9:15. Newt had arrived at 8:45. The intruder had come in at approximately 9:04 by Newt’s time. And Victor had arrived at 9:20.</p>
      
      <p>So how had Becket fooled them? Had he perhaps left the meeting early, unreported? Had someone else done his dirty work? Was Victor covering for Becket?</p>
      
      <p>He came back to himself again; it was a moment later. Getting lost in thought, that was nothing new. But this was different. The rope was dropping him down into the chasm, bit by bit, but he could never remember falling. He just kept finding himself deeper and deeper. It was his short-term memory, he realized, like back in Thurston’s office. It wasn’t integrating.</p>
      
      <p>With another jolt, he came back to the present moment again. Newt realized all at once that he was in trouble. He looked at his hands, and felt the nauseating disconnect between the act and his desire to do it. He didn’t remember wanting to do that—was he in control of what he was doing?</p>
      
      <p>He touched the tips of his fingers to his thumbs. The sensation, repeated, felt real; it felt like putting his thoughts outside of his head. He kept doing it.</p>
      
      <p>He was stepping off the train and onto the platform. As his heel landed on the pavement with a jolt, he ran back over the last minute. He had stood up and walked out of the train car and down the little steps, right? He must have. But he had no memory of doing so.</p>
      
      <p>Now he was walking along the platform. The crowd of commuting strangers carried him onward. The motion and the jolting of walking was grounding him a bit. Something else was running, in the background, unsupervised. Something about the sign-in sheet, the meeting, the stables. There was something there...</p>
      
      <p>But a weight was pulling him, jolt by jolt, down the rope. What was down there, in the dark below? What if the rope snapped?</p>
      
      <p>The jolts came every three steps. Now every two. He was stopped under a two-sided clock. A bell was tolling the hour. The clock above him still said it was one minute til. How long had he been waiting for the minute to finish?</p>
      
      <p>He was unstuck from time. But his long-term memory still worked.</p>
      
      <p>He felt something on his lip. He tasted iron. Blood.</p>
      
      <p>It clicked into place.</p>
      
      <p>“Oh,” whispered Newt. “I know how he did it.”</p>
      
      <p>On the platform, the flow of commuters halted and circled. Somebody was shouting, calling for help, a medic, and somebody was on their knees taking the pulse of the unconscious man.</p>
