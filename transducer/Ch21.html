        <strong>Epilogue</strong>
    </h1>
      
      <p>THE LATE MARCH STORMS took everyone by surprise. It had been an unusually wet and blustery winter. For months, the Pacific had been restless, with winds so strong they could hear the waves as far inland as the quad. But Professor of Electrical Engineering Dr. Montgomery, affectionately nicknamed Monty, never seemed to mind.</p>
      
      <p>The small public college was perched on the California coast, just inland from the coastal highway, which was just inland from sharp cliffs. It was too far north for a warm winter, but far enough south to catch the AM rock radio from the Bay Area. The school had a robust liberal arts department, a well-known teaching program, and a sciences department small enough to fit in one cement building. Because of the program’s small size, its funding was scarce, but subject to little oversight. The founding of the HAM radio club, the requisitioning of the required equipment, all of it went relatively unnoticed by the admin—or by the Science Department Chair, Professor Roger “Sleepy” Steele—until it was too late.</p>
      
      <p>But for now, that day was a few months away. Professor Monty, in spite of the cold March rain, zoomed across campus on his Vespa. He called out greetings to students in his classes, and to the members of his HAM radio club. They all shouted and waved back. In the tiny, tight-knit science program, Professor Monty was well-liked. Despite his forgetfulness about returning assignments, he was a forgiving grader, held helpful tutorial sessions, and made appearances at every student demonstration. Overall they found him engagingly eccentric. For instance, despite apparent ease on his motor scooter, when he walked, he sometimes seemed to list a little to the left. He was also hard of hearing in his left ear. And he talked so much that you could almost walk away without noticing that he had told you nothing of substance about himself.</p>
      
      <p>Monty could often be seen eating lunch with Professor Conrad, a math professor. Conrad’s tests were very difficult and harshly curved, but he reused the same ones each semester, so his answer sheets went for a premium in the dorms. He seemed to be an old friend of Monty’s, but the students did not waste much speculation on someone so boring. Not even Conrad’s English accent could make him intriguing.</p>
      
      <p>The warning signs had been invisible to most, but not to Kate Irwin. A close observer, she had been watching developments from day one. Sullenly quiet but whip-smart, Kate disliked citrus fruits and eye contact. At a young age, she had skipped grades and been accepted to Caltech at age 15. She’d dropped out at 17. She’d ended up here, at the low-ranked college three freeway exits from her parents’ house.</p>
      
      <p>In her freshman year introductory circuit theory course, Professor Monty told them he would be starting a HAM radio club. Kate had impulsively volunteered, out of loneliness and boredom. So it was that she found herself spending Thursday afternoons in the engineering lab, squinting at circuit boards with Scott from the water polo team.</p>
      
      <p>She liked circuitry—she liked the difficult sets of rules, and the endless possibilities they generated. She liked how Professor Monty called her “Katie,” which no one had called her since grade school. But her favorite part was post-meeting, when the dozen-odd students piled into cars and drove to the burger joint near the cliffs. Sometimes Professor Conrad helped drive them.</p>
      
      <p>Among the HAM radio club members, it was popularly believed that Monty had a dark, secret past. Kate learned of this theory sometime in winter semester of her freshman year, in Scott’s friend Lucas’s car, en route to the burgers. He—Monty—knew a lot about computers, Scott said to her, twisted around in the passenger seat with the white sun behind him. The <em>real</em> computer research, he said, went down in the defense industry. “He’s probably ex-military, or even NASA.”</p>
      
      <p>“And that’s why he can’t talk about his past,” Lucas, driving, added.</p>
      
      <p>“He’s probably deaf on one side from an accident,” said Scott. “Like an experiment gone wrong.”</p>
      
      <p>Kate frowned. She was skeptical.</p>
      
      <p>But over the next year, she did develop a theory of her own—not about Monty, but about Dr. Conrad. The following fall, her sophomore year, she obtained special permission to take his number theory seminar for seniors. Much as she loved Monty, Conrad’s teaching style suited her far better. And she could tell he was smart. Far too smart for their backwater school. He often mentioned his education at Cambridge, and his research, though it was always in vague terms. Whenever they discussed recent research, she wondered why he wasn’t the one making those discoveries. Kate wondered how he had ended up here. Perhaps projecting her own sadness, she felt a kinship with that missed opportunity.</p>
      
      <p>Later, when the situation with the exosphere antenna got truly out of hand, it would be said that it was the students’ idea. The HAM radio club spent the whole summer building it. In the fall of their third year, they strapped the antenna to the roof of a van, piled in, and drove across the desert to a UFO-watching festival in Nevada. Dr. Conrad was not much involved with the club by this point. In the blue, dusty desert night, among the hippies and the tin-hats and their telescopes, the HAM radio club set up their huge, homemade antenna. And as the moon rose, they listened to the static, searching for a solid signal among the noise from the stars.</p>
      
      <p>
        <span>Now it was March, and winter was drawing to a close. The radio club’s exosphere antenna stood on the roof of the sciences building—still unnoticed by the authorities, but not for much longer. Wherever the idea had begun, it was Monty who made the project his top priority. Passers-by on that rainy March night might have noticed the white Vespa still parked outside, or the light still on in the top corner room. They might have wondered what he could be working on, so late. </span>
      </p>
      
      <p>At home, Dr. Conrad sat with their cat. He was trying to read a book, but kept glancing at the phone.</p>
      
      <p>Only he knew what he was listening for.</p>
