    <h1>
    20. The Port
    </h1>
      
      <p>NEWT CAME TO, SLOWLY, in the passenger seat. The hum of the engine at first sounded like the transducer. The windshield wipers beat a fierce tattoo against the onslaught of rain, the kind of thunderless downpour that cannot last. There was a sickly sweet smell in his nose and mouth. He blinked slowly, dazed, and found that he could see, but one eye was out of focus. He blinked a few times—<em>was it the transducer? Had it affected his optical nerve somehow?—</em>before realizing the lens of his glasses had cracked.</p>
      
      <p>It took another moment or two before he could move his head. He forced it to turn sideways.</p>
      
      <p>“Where are you…?” he mumbled, the words slurring out.</p>
      
      <p>He blinked a few more times, bringing the driver beside him into focus.</p>
      
      <p>“Victor?”</p>
      
      <p>The Vice Chief did not turn or acknowledge him.</p>
      
      <p>“Where are we going?” he said again, more articulated this time. “What’s going on?”</p>
      
      <p>Awareness was fluttering back in with the swoop-swoop of the wipers. Newt’s hands wanted to move, but couldn’t. He was cuffed.</p>
      
      <p>“You,” said Newt breathlessly. “You set me up. You’re Orpheus.”</p>
      
      <p>A sneer gathered in the corner of Victor’s crooked lips, but still he said nothing.</p>
      
      <p>“But—but that’s impossible.” Newt’s voice rose. “You hate the Russians. You would never work for them. You wouldn’t! What are you doing? Where are you taking me?”</p>
      
      <p>The sneer transformed into a full-flown grimace.</p>
      
      <p>“I’m not a mole, you bloody idiot,” Victor said finally, and his voice was icy calm. “I don’t work for them. This is a one-time exchange.”</p>
      
      <p>“The trade? It’s tonight?” said Newt. A chill settled over him. “And you’re trading me.”</p>
      
      <p>Victor did not reply. He flicked the windshield wipers, and they slowed to a calmer rate. Outside, the rolling storm was easing, revealing the dark, misty landscape rolling by. There was not a car or a house or a single light in sight anywhere in the velvety darkness.</p>
      
      <p>“What are you trading me for?” said Newt.</p>
      
      <p>“A prisoner,” said Victor, a strange, forced casualness strangling his words. He took one hand from the wheel and reached inside his breast pocket. He extracted a cigarette, and lit with the car lighter as he spoke: “Originally, it was the transducer, and the blueprints, in exchange for a prisoner. But since you stole it, I’ve made adjustments. I don’t have time to take it out of your ear before my appointment. You’ve made scheduling a bit complicated. So I’ll just hand you over.”</p>
      
      <p>Newt’s heartbeat quickened, sending the dashboard and windshield spinning away in vertigo. The transducer. Victor thought he still had it.</p>
      
      <p>And that was probably the only thing keeping him alive.</p>
      
      <p>“They won’t mind,” Victor was saying. “They’ll like you. They can pump you for information. In fact, it’s a fairer trade. One for the other.”</p>
      
      <p>“One what for the other?” said Newt.</p>
      
      <p>“Prisoner,” said Victor, again.</p>
      
      <p>“Who’s the prisoner?” Newt managed, voice slightly choked.</p>
      
      <p>“Charles,” said Victor, exhaling smoke. “Rennie,” he added after a half-second pause.</p>
      
      <p>Newt’s eyes widened. “You—you know he’s alive.”</p>
      
      <p>Victor’s face creaked into a crooked, humorless grimace.</p>
      
      <p>“And you...” Newt opened his mouth, trying to follow Victor’s calculation. “He’s your...” Newt’s jaw slackened. “You think he’s a prisoner,” he murmured. “You think he’s a prisoner. You don’t think he’s a traitor. You think the Raz is holding him. Victor—” His heart fluttered with trapped-bird panic, his words tumbling out on top of each other. “He was—he’s not—he was working with Bowen the whole time. He’s playing you. Bowen is playing you. It’s a trick. It’s a trick! You can’t—you can’t seriously think—”</p>
      
      <p>But his words fell on deaf ears. The simple truth was that Victor did not care.</p>
      
      <p align="center">*</p>
      
      <p>Without thinking, Hermann took off running.</p>
      
      <p>His run was lopsided and not fast. With every step his hip seized up tighter. His legs knew he had a better chance of hiding than outpacing. So he made for the garage nearest the house, less than 50 meters’ distance—nothing more than a floodlight and a gray shape in the torrent. The rain in his eyes nearly blinded him. The footsteps behind him grew louder apace, closer, spitting gravel. Rivulets of rainwater formed creekbeds in the gravel drive, and he heard his pursuer stumble in one, sending a splash and a curse.</p>
      
      <p>Hermann’s free hand reached out and connected with the wood doorframe. With a jerk he pulled himself up short, and then he yanked open the door and pulled himself inside.</p>
      
      <p>He slammed the door shut behind him. It was dark inside. There was a toolbox on a heavy chair by the door—in a panic, he upended both in front of the door. His breath caught up with him and he gasped, staggering backwards, all his adrenaline and panic surging to his throat, and he thought he might be sick. His leg and hip were seizing up. He couldn’t take another step without collapsing.</p>
      
      <p>A heavy, wet thump hit the door he’d just closed. But the chair blocked it, and the intruder withdrew, making no second attempt. The shadow moved across the light around the doorframe and disappeared.</p>
      
      <p>The rain roared on the wooden roof.</p>
      
      <p>Hermann cast around the dark garage, no time to form a plan—he was taking inventory, object, object, object. Object equaled use. Breathing purposefully to keep his asthmatic lungs from wheezing, he inventoried, just as he’d been trained, before dispatch, on this very campus. Slowly, he twisted his leg, loosening his joints. When the front double doors swung open less than twenty seconds later, he was already moving.</p>
      
      <p>The noise and the floodlit curtain of rain rushed in. Hermann stepped from behind the car and swung the iron golf club, gripped in both hands, without mercy at his assailant’s shins. The man cried out and buckled, and Hermann dropped the club and came up with the flat edge of his hand straight into the man’s windpipe. His assailant choked and fell, but only to his knees. His hand flew out and grabbed Hermann’s wrist with shocking strength, and Hermann registered that his attacker was lower to the ground than the towering Raleigh Becket should be, and that his hair was dark, slick from the rain. Then he was jerked downward—Hermann bent, locking his knees and straining to remain on his feet, but his leg was weak and the man had a vicious density. He dragged him down, slamming him onto the concrete and wrenching his shoulder. Victory slackened his assailant’s grip for a second and Hermann twisted his right hand, wrestling, a losing game, but an engrossing one, while his left hand, unaccounted for, searched the concrete floor—</p>
      
      <p>Basic combat training taught them to aim for the eyes, the throat, and the groin. Division employees were not expected to get into scraps, and if they did, they were expected to be merciless, for in this business, if it came to confrontation, it was life or death.</p>
      
      <p>His attacker was making a horrible growling sound, as his other hand wrestled with Hermann’s convulsing shoulder and grappled for his throat. His tie was falling into Hermann’s eyes and all he could see of his face were snatches of bared teeth and skin creased in a grimace of hatred. Then with a gasp of satisfaction, a vindictive “Ha!” the attacker found his throat, and Hermann recognized his voice. It was the Vice Chief’s assistant, Preston Blair.</p>
      
      <p>“No—” Hermann gasped.</p>
      
      <p>“Pathetic,” hissed Preston, pressing down on his throat.</p>
      
      <p>Hermann’s lungs were pumping and losing airflow had a quick, meaningful effect. He gasped and choked, his left hand spasming in its search, but as Preston leaned in, grimacing like Hermann was the man who had killed his mother and was going to pay at last, Hermann’s hand brushed against metal and he grasped it—a wrench, fallen from the toolbox—brought it up, and slammed it into Preston’s face.</p>
      
      <p>Someone cried out and there was a crack—it was probably the jaw, Hermann couldn’t tell, but the chokehold disappeared and blood was falling onto Hermann’s face from Preston’s open mouth. Hermann flailed, his arms acting on fierce, thoughtless instinct. His hands found Preston’s face and pushed him away, and he fell on his side, stunned but groping for Hermann still. The wrench blow had hit him full in the temple and the jaw, Hermann saw as he scrambled up into a sitting position. His back hit a tire, and he pulled himself up on the car. There was a lot of blood in his mouth and he still wasn’t breathing correctly. Hermann saw the bloody wrench and realized, with a bloom of pain reaching his brain, that it had fallen onto his own nose. It was broken.</p>
      
      <p>Preston was on his hands and knees in front of the car, leaving a trail of blood and saliva on the concrete. He was making a wheezing noise like a rusty spring.</p>
      
      <p>“They’re... long gone,” he hacked out. “You’ll never catch them.”</p>
      
      <p>“Where?” said Hermann, throat clotted. “Where is he taking Newton?” he said again, when Preston didn’t answer.</p>
      
      <p>He made the rusty wheezing sound again. It was a laugh, Hermann realized.</p>
      
      <p>“Why are you helping him?” said Hermann.</p>
      
      <p>“You’ll never make it,” said Preston from the floor. “You’re no threat at all.”</p>
      
      <p>“Where are they going?” said Hermann, standing over him.</p>
      
      <p>“The port,” croaked Preston.</p>
      
      <p>“Why?” said Hermann.</p>
      
      <p>Preston just laughed again. It was a horrible sound. He tried to get up again, but it wasn’t working. He kept falling over.</p>
      
      <p>Hermann turned away. Spitting out blood, he found his cane. Then he staggered around the car, to the last item from his inventory: Newton’s motorbike, parked by the doors, kickstand down, helmet hanging neatly from the handlebar.</p>
      
      <p>“You’ll never—make it,” rasped Preston again from the other side of the car. Hermann pretended not to hear him.</p>
      
      <p align="center">*</p>
      
      <p>A light, steady rain fell as they entered the industrial port of Yarmouth. The entrance gate was raised, but the guard’s booth was empty. Low sheds rolled by, all deserted. Silent parked cars waited in the darkness between the sheds, raindrops glittering on their black windshields. It was empty, like it had been abandoned a decade ago.</p>
      
      <p>Victor drove slowly. Newt couldn’t tell whether it was certainty or controlled anxiety. At the end of an alley, the pavement turned to stone, and they turned abreast of the docks. The sea vista was blocked by boats, their portholes bobbing above Newt’s eyeline. There were parked cars here, too, and Newt imagined them all full of black-clad agents, tracking them with guns through invisible balistrariae. But there was no sign of life.</p>
      
      <p>They stopped. Victor turned off the engine, locked the parking brake, then checked Newt’s handcuffs. He got out of the car, opening an umbrella over his head. He left the keys in the ignition, and Newt briefly considered lunging for them. When he unlocked the passenger door, Newt discovered that Victor was holding a second umbrella, which he helpfully opened and placed in Newt’s bound hands. Then he conducted Newt forward in front of him by his arm, leaving the driver’s door open and the dome light on.</p>
      
      <p>They walked down the slick wooden dock, in the shadow of a shipping vessel’s massive, immobile hull. Newt, cuffed and walking in front of his captor, strained to listen for some sound, but there was nothing. No footsteps, no voices, no distant engines in hot pursuit. There was only the waves against the hulls of the empty ships, the hiss of the rain, and the ropes creaking in the wind.</p>
      
      <p>They reached the end of the cargo ship’s hull and stepped out of the shadow, into a misty cone of light. Victor turned him right, out onto an in-between dock that jutted into the harbor. At that moment, Newt thought he heard something overhead—a creak or a door opening, far up in the cargo ship above them—but when he turned, he couldn’t see anything, and the rain spattered his glasses.</p>
      
      <p>Victor jerked his arm, reorienting him on his path forward.</p>
      
      <p>Moored beside the dock was a fishing boat, medium size, painted red, bobbing gently in the waves. The light was coming from there, from the bright searchlight immobile above its deck. In the rain and the light, Newt could make out three figures on the deck. Victor’s grip tightened on his arm.</p>
      
      <p>The Vice Chief brought him to the foot of the gangway, which was a short slope up to the deck of the red fishing boat. The figures were standing in the lee of the searchlight, in shadow, and as Newt’s eyes adjusted, he made out the differences between them. Two were soldiers, overdressed in long, heavy coats. One had a medal pinned to his collar. The other held a gun of implausible size. In between them stood a slimmer man, more smartly dressed. He had glasses and a receding hairline. His hands, gloved, were crossed at his waist.</p>
      
      <p>“Where’s Robert?” said Victor, without preamble. His voice echoed strangely between the metal hulls.</p>
      
      <p>“Good evening, Vice Chief,” said the man in civilian clothing, his accent slight but Russian. “You have brought a prisoner? I do not recall that part of our agreement.”</p>
      
      <p>“We’ll get to that,” said Victor. “Let’s start with the blueprints.”</p>
      
      <p>The Russian paused, then nodded once. “As you wish.”</p>
      
      <p>He signalled slightly with his head, and one of the soldiers—the one without a gun—stepped smartly down the gangway.</p>
      
      <p>“Don’t try running,” Victor murmured to Newt, unexpectedly close. Newt tensed as Victor released his grip. There was a shuffling behind him and then Victor produced a manila envelope. He handed it over to the soldier. The soldier took it and returned to his master.</p>
      
      <p>“I’ll hold onto the device until I’ve seen the prisoner,” said Victor.</p>
      
      <p>The Russian made no response, taking the envelope from his lackey and opening it. He slid the papers out and examined them. The armed soldier produced a flashlight and shone it over his shoulder, so he could read.</p>
      
      <p>“Where’s Bowen?” Victor said again. “My deal was with him. I want to see him.”</p>
      
      <p>“We have your prisoner,” said the Russian, sliding the papers back into the envelope. He jerked his head at his guard, who flicked the torch off. “But your friend Bowen is not here.”</p>
      
      <p>“My deal was with him,” repeated Victor.</p>
      
      <p>“He was your contact, yes,” said the Russian. “Since this operation—this trade—was his idea, we asked him to handle the communications with you. He has, how would you say... more fluency.” He gave a little smile. Newt’s heart contracted even tighter. He shook his head. <em>They’re playing you, Victor,</em> he thought, <em>they’re taking you for a ride, and I’m the deer about to get hit along the way. </em>“Of course, we needed someone keeping an eye closer, paving your way, making life a little easier for you. So Mr. Becket, he came in handy. And he told us that your operation last week did not go off just as planned. But you are a talented improviser. Here is the device, nonetheless.”</p>
      
      <p>The Russian gestured at Newt, making eye contact with him for the first time.</p>
      
      <p>“Dr. Geiszler, isn’t it?” he said. “It’s a pleasure.” He smiled a little, and Newt saw gold fillings flash.</p>
      
      <p>Victor had re-clamped Newt’s arm, and Newt was trying to pull himself free again.</p>
      
      <p>“The pleasure’s all yours,” said Newt, his bravado falling flat on delivery.</p>
      
      <p>“An excellent choice for a patsy, from what I know of you. Who would trust an American, after all? Americans are... what is that charming expression? So <em>wishy-washy</em>.”</p>
      
      <p>The Russian allowed himself a smile. Newt twisted his arm, trying to pull away.</p>
      
      <p>“Let go of me,” he hissed at Victor.</p>
      
      <p>“They’ll just shoot you if you run.”</p>
      
      <p>“So you have the device, then,” the Russian called down to Newt. “And you’re going to give it to us? Or, are you coming with us instead?”</p>
      
      <p>“I don’t have it,” Newt said. “I lost it.”</p>
      
      <p>The Russian just chuckled.</p>
      
      <p>“How unfortunate.”</p>
      
      <p>“No, really,” said Newt, twisting his arm again. Victor held on. “I threw it away. I dropped in the toilet.”</p>
      
      <p>“That <em>is </em>a shame,” said the Russian, amused by this lie. “Do you think you’d like to come with us nonetheless? Victor needs you out of the way. And I’m sure we could find you some useful employ in Moscow.”</p>
      
      <p>Before Newt could respond, a sound came from inland. The whine of a motorcycle engine swung into hearing, like a distant fighter jet.</p>
      
      <p align="center">*</p>
      
      <p>Hermann tried to slow down as he wove between the sheds, but not much, because he had spent the last half hour in fear of tipping over. He burst out from between the last stacks of crates and slammed on the brakes, because the water was <em>right there, </em>and as he placed his foot down to catch himself, he saw the parked car, door open, dome light on. Gritting his teeth against the imbalance and the pain, he wrenched the handlebars to the left and gave it one last push of gas. He coasted to a stop just in front of the car and stopped the motorbike, at last.</p>
      
      <p>He turned it off and pulled out the keys, whispering, “Never again,” as he staggered off. He pulled his cane from the side where it had laid under his knee, and righted himself on the cobblestone. His shoulder was on fire, and he couldn’t breathe from his nose. The pain of unbending his bad leg from the motorcycle, which he’d been dreading most of all, was worse than he’d been prepared for. He staggered for a moment as he unbuckled the helmet, and tried to step forward with his cane. Then he heard voices, coming from out on the dock.</p>
      
      <p>He stumbled towards the dock. There was a light coming from the bow of the cargo ship. Up high on the deck, he saw movement, so he ducked closer to the hull, out of their sights.</p>
      
      <p>The voices grew louder. He could hear Newton.</p>
      
      <p>He burst into the light with no plan in mind. “Stop!” he shouted.</p>
      
      <p>“Hermann!”</p>
      
      <p>Victor wrenched Newt back behind himself.</p>
      
      <p>Hermann stumbled down the dock.</p>
      
      <p>“Look out!” Newt shouted, shoving at his captor with his bound hands and dropping his umbrella. “Stop, Hermann, stop!”</p>
      
      <p>“Halt there,” said the Russian’s voice calmly, not loudly, yet completely audible. “Now.”</p>
      
      <p>Hermann stopped. The soldier on the deck was pointing his enormous gun at him. The other soldier had produced a pistol, and was pointing that at him as well.</p>
      
      <p>“Stop now,” said the Russian, “and stay still.” He turned back to Victor. “The adults are talking.”</p>
      
      <p>He smiled his gold-clotted smile at Victor, who was holding the struggling Newt still. Hermann stood frozen, feet fixed, swaying in place.</p>
      
      <p>“No more time to waste, Victor,” said the Russian. “Your people are coming. Hand him over.”</p>
      
      <p>“Not until I see Charles,” said Victor.</p>
      
      <p>“Is anyone going to ask <em>this </em>prisoner what he wants? Or has?” said Newt, in a shrill voice. “Because I’m not joking. I <em>don’t </em>have the transducer.”</p>
      
      <p>Up the dock, Hermann inhaled. <em>Charles</em>. He was trading for Rennie. <em>Of course.</em></p>
      
      <p>Of course Victor knew Rennie was alive.</p>
      
      <p>And of course he still thought Rennie was innocent.</p>
      
      <p>The Russian nodded to one of the soldiers, and he disappeared through a door, into the cabin.</p>
      
      <p>There was a long pause. The waves splashed gently. The rain hissed.</p>
      
      <p>Then they heard footsteps, and the cabin door opened.</p>
      
      <p>The soldier pushed a man out onto the deck. To Newt and Hermann’s equal astonishment, out stumbled the bowed, bound figure of Charles Rennie.</p>
      
      <p>He was hard to make out in the shadows. He had aged, far more than ten years. His jaunty mustache was gone, and his clothes were thin and torn. His high forehead shone with sweat.</p>
      
      <p>On Newt’s arm, Victor’s grip slackened. Newt himself was too shocked to move.</p>
      
      <p>It was no trick. He was a prisoner.</p>
      
      <p>The soldier brought him up behind the leader, and jerked him to a stop. Rennie’s eyes lifted, and found Victor on the dock.</p>
      
      <p>The hand gripping Newt let go completely.</p>
      
      <p>The Russian, watching the proceedings intently, signaled to the soldier. He pushed Rennie forward again, and they moved down the gangway.</p>
      
      <p>“Victor,” said Charles, eyes wide as they approached. His voice rose. “Victor—they trapped me. I found Robert, I offered him the device, but then he didn’t let me leave, and then—”</p>
      
      <p>“Charles, don’t—”</p>
      
      <p>They were halfway down the gangway. The soldier’s eyes were on Newt. He was going to take him.</p>
      
      <p>Newt’s legs trembled, and started to tense, to run, they couldn’t, they wouldn’t take him—</p>
      
      <p>With a whoosh and a clatter behind Newt, Victor dropped his umbrella to the ground.</p>
      
      <p>“I thought you were d—”</p>
      
      <p>A <em>bang </em>rang out. The echo ricocheted between the hulls. Someone yelled, someone else shouted, Newt was pushed aside and falling down. Charles Rennie crumpled. Victor dove.</p>
      
      <p>Up on the deck, the heads of the soldier and his master vanished, and there was yelling in Russian. Newt crouched on the dock, arm covering his face. He could hear Hermann yelling too. It sounded like “op—op—op—” The engine of the red ship came to life. Victor was screaming and shouting behind him. Two shots tore from the direction of the fishing boat.</p>
      
      <p>Newt lowered his arm just enough to look up, with one eye, in the direction of the shot. The shooter was standing up on the deck of the cargo ship, staring down in horror. Their eyes locked.</p>
      
      <p>“Cait?” Newt yelled. “Caitlin!” he screamed over the roar of the engine and the shouting Russian voices. “Caitlin, no!”</p>
      
      <p>Lightcap watched the chaos unfold on the dock below her, frozen in horror. She watched Hermann stagger towards Newt, watched the water swirl around the fishing boat’s engine, watched Victor, clutching the body of Charles Rennie.</p>
      
      <p>“I thought it was him,” she said. But Newt couldn’t hear her.</p>
      
      <p>The soldier on the dock had not retreated. Instead, crouching, he made for Newt and lunged at him. There was a second shot from above and the soldier cried out, falling back. Newt yelled “No!” and threw his arm up over his face. There was a splash as the soldier dropped into the water.</p>
      
      <p>The engine of the fishing boat was roaring. Hermann finally reached Newt and dragged him back, up the dock and away from the commotion. The ship was trying to pull away, but the gangway was still down. Victor was prone on the ground over the body of Rennie. Newt was yelling something indistinguishable. Hermann pulled Newt to his feet, shielding his head, just as the ship, engine straining, tore free of the gangway. With an explosion of wood and water and a horrible <em>crack, </em>the gangway shattered. Newt and Victor both cried out. The explosion echoed all up and down the hulls and out across the water.</p>
      
      <p>They had reached the stone shore. Newt was blubbering as they stumbled up the dark alley.</p>
      
      <p>“We have to get out of here,” Hermann was saying, dragging Newt around the corner, away from the screaming Vice Chief. “You have to drive, Newton, I can’t—”</p>
      
      <p>“You can’t, you can’t—”</p>
      
      <p>“Newton! What are you saying?”</p>
      
      <p>“I saw her—Hermann, it was Cait—”</p>
      
      <p>“No, that’s impossible—”</p>
      
      <p>“Stop, I have to find her! Stop, listen to me!”</p>
      
      <p>As they staggered up the stone, towards the car and the motorbike, they could hear engines and sirens approaching. Then a metal door slammed, and a figure flew down the metal gangway in the darkness up ahead of them.</p>
      
      <p>“C—Caitlin!” Newt yelled. “Cait, stop!”</p>
      
      <p>She stopped. She turned to look at them, some 20 meters ahead. Hermann stopped, gripping Newt for support. Newt was trying to catch his breath, trying to say something.</p>
      
      <p>But she didn’t wait for him to speak. Without a word she ran to the waiting car and started the engine.</p>
      
      <p>“Wait! Stop! Cait!” Newt yelled, trying to run after her. Hermann held him back. “Stop, stop!”</p>
      
      <p>“Newton, we have to go—”</p>
      
      <p>“Let go, let go!” He was sobbing. “Let go of me!”</p>
      
      <p>Hermann did not. The engine revved, and she drove away into the night.</p>
      
      <p>When the convoy of Division officers, internal security, Estate staff, CIA visitors, and U.S. Army arrived moments later, they found a broken gangway, two bodies, and an insensible Vice Chief. Among the debris, two upended umbrellas floated in the water, filling up with rain. When they questioned Victor about the bodies, he gave no coherent answers. Someone else identified Rennie’s body as a former agent, formerly presumed dead. Victor was taken into custody, and an inquiry was launched.</p>
      
      <p>The inquiry was meant to be discreet, but the story eventually came out. It was the CIA liaison, Mr. Rosewater, absolutely furious, who leaked it to the American press. From there, it eventually traveled back across the Atlantic. The transatlantic intelligence partnership suffered another blow, as did British confidence in the secret services. But the public never learned the true extent of the disaster.</p>
      
      <p>They knew that it was a security breach. They knew that two low-level Division techs had been in clandestine contact with Russian agents, and shared confidential documents with them. They knew that the techs had stolen an American prototype for a highly classified piece of stealth technology. They knew that the hand-off had been in June, and that violence had erupted somehow, and they knew they the pair was now missing, and presumed to have fled east.</p>
      
      <p>The techs’ contact, the story went, was a defector named Charles Rennie. At the trade point, he had been shot. Details of Vice Chief Victor’s presence were kept out of the press, but he never saw the inside of his office again.</p>
      
      <p>Rennie’s killer was never identified or caught, the story went. And that, at least, was true.</p>
      
      <p align="center">*</p>
      
      <p>On the motorbike, Newt paused first in an alley behind a building. He and Hermann listened to the sirens reach their destination and halt, to the engines turning off and doors opening and slamming shut, voices barking orders. Then they rolled slowly and quietly out of the industrial port, gliding onto the main road. They rode until the edge of town, and then sped up, back onto the highway, and into the night. The night air had cleared and cooled. The rain was not coming back.</p>
      
      <p>Newton insisted that Hermann take the single helmet, since he had probably already suffered a concussion. He drove, and Hermann held him around the waist. Newton was warm, in his own jacket again. Closing his eyes, Hermann rested his head on the back of Newt’s neck. His ears were still ringing with the commotion—the bullets, the engines, the haunting cries of Victor. As they accelerated down a straight, flat stretch of road, Hermann felt something vibrating in his hands, where they were clasped around Newt’s ribcage. He realized Newt was singing. He tightened his grip and strained to hear, to make sense of something over the roaring of the engine and the scream of the wind.</p>
      
      <p>
        <em>I won't be running from the rain when I'm gone</em>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <em>And I can't even suffer from the pain when I'm gone</em>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <em>Can't say who's to praise and who's to blame when I'm gone...</em>
      </p>
      
      <p>Newt sang to keep himself grounded, and kept his eyes, with tears flowing freely, fixed on the dark road ahead of them.</p>
