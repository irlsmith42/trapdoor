    <p><b>Acknowledgments</b></p>
    <p>Thank you to my editor and fact-checker <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/users/EarthedLightning/pseuds/EarthedLightning">Sasha</a>, aka lesbian linguist drummer Laurie. You made it easy to keep going, and your help made the story so much better. Thanks also to my roommate, aka Newt’s bassist Vivian, for all the hot takes on composers. And thank you to friends reading and commenting throughout! El, semiautomagic, femmedatalia, kscijanitor, exsomia, buckgaybarnes, sommerrev, and of course, Holo. Thank you &lt;3 </p>

<p><b>Bibliography</b></p>
<p>Nonfiction: <i>A Spy Among Friends: Kim Philby and the Great Betrayal</i> by Ben McIntyre; <i>The Code Book</i> by Simon Singh; <i>Intercept: The Secret History of Computers and Spies</i> by Gordon Corera.</p> 
    
<p>Fiction: Heavily influenced by <i>Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy</i> and <i>A Perfect Spy</i> by John le Carré, and <i>The Heat of the Day</i> by Elizabeth Bowen, as well as <em>Designations Congruent With Things</em> by cleanwhiteroom, of course. Dorothy L. Sayers’ Lord Peter Wimsey books, for tips on mystery and intellectual romance. I did read <i>The Untouchable</i> by John Banville halfway through writing this, which is coincidentally about a disgraced British Cold War spy named Victor, but I hated it. <a href="https://davidfosterwallaceandgromit.tumblr.com/post/615946822198984704/transducer-annotated-bibliography">Full annotated bibliography can be found here</a>.
