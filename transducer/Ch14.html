        <strong>14. Record Match</strong>
      </h2>
      
      <p align="right">August, 1971</p>
      
      <p align="right">Berlin, G.D.R.</p>
      
      <p>IT HAD BEEN A MONTH since his eyes had opened. Some parts of him had woken quickly—his mind, his eyes were still sharp—but some parts took longer. Standing up straight was still hard work, and walking quickly put him out of breath. Sometimes his voice got lost in his throat, like a bad dream; chewing was hard, his jaw didn’t work right. He knew he ought to eat, to regain his strength, but it felt as though he’d forgotten how. He sweat too much, and got cold, and shivered in the sunlight. Sometimes, his attention wandered, and when it came back, he felt he could have forgotten his own name.</p>
      
      <p>He had made contact with his old office as soon as he was able. All new staff, of course, and no one knew who he was. When he invoked Robert Bowen, they told him they’d send a message to Headquarters. That had been two weeks ago now. No reply yet, but he was patient. He knew how to tug at the threads. A reactivated agent with a secret to sell, who knew Bowen personally, that was a story that would pique someone’s interest, sooner or later. Ideally, it would travel up the line to Robert, wherever he was. He understood life was rather cutthroat in the Raz, and he wondered how that suited Robert after a life playing a jovially quiet con.</p>
      
      <p>So he waited. He had money and a passport, recovered from where he’d cached them a decade before. He had a hotel room, close to a library, where he read up on the news. He felt like he was still in peaceful, secret stasis. He absorbed the events of the last few years with the bemused interest of a time traveler. The gears of the world had spun on without his hand for a little while—but not for much longer.</p>
      
      <p>He slept long, hot nights, and could feel his strength coming back. One morning, he woke up ravenously hungry. After he ate, he took the bus to the outskirts of the city.</p>
      
      <p>The only people on the pre-noon bus leaving town were tiny old women and one sweaty farmer. Outside the streaked windows, the streets and buildings turned abruptly to farmland. He disembarked at the top of a dusty hill. The sun was bright and hot; the heat wave that had woken him had not yet broken. He walked slowly down the slope, leaning on his walking stick. He passed that pub where he’d met his handler a few times, heading towards the church spire.</p>
      
      <p>It was an old stone church, long disused. Pigeons and doves cooed and fluttered in the eaves of the rotting roof as he walked below. Behind it there was a cemetery, barely more than a handful of eroded gravestones. He stopped at the corner and shaded his eyes with his hand. He checked his watch. It wasn’t time yet. He wished he had a better visual memory, but at least he had forethought.</p>
      
      <p>He crossed the grass, stepped over the stone wall, and strolled across a cow pasture. There was a barn at the top of the slope. He saw no one about. It didn’t take long for him to find a shovel. He took it. Victor would have laughed at this, he thought. Well, he would bring it back.</p>
      
      <p>His thoughts had turned often to Victor, since waking up.</p>
      
      <p>It was just noon when he returned to the church. The shadow of the spire fell straight back from the center of the building, perpendicular across the churchyard. Stepping over the stones in his path, his walking stick in one hand, his shovel in the other, he followed the shadow of the spire.</p>
      
      <p>When he had buried this cache box, it had been winter. The ground had been hard, and he’d been in a hurry, and in the weak, oblique December sunlight, the shadow had reached farther. Standing in the middle of the cemetery now, eight years later, supporting himself with a walking stick and a stolen shovel, he squinted at the stone wall. The cross landed in the middle of the lush grass. He had no idea what stone he had buried it under.</p>
      
      <p>“Couldn’t have slept another five months, could you?” he muttered to himself.</p>
      
      <p>A warm breeze rustled across the grass and through his hair. His hairline had receded while he’d slept. But it had also grown longer, and been trimmed. A stranger trimming his hair while he slept—strange to think of. He lifted his arm to smooth it back down, and as he did so, his shadow did too.</p>
      
      <p><em>Of course.</em> Just like a sundial. Rennie stepped into the shadow of the cross, and the top of his shadow extended the line, past the last gravestone. He raised his stolen shovel over his head, and the tip of the shovel reached the wall. There.</p>
      
      <p>He could only dig a few strokes at a time before he needed to rest. Sweat beaded on the back of his neck, and evaporated quickly in the sun. Just when he was starting to get tired, and think he would have to take another break, his shovel hit something—something harder than wood but softer than rock. Rennie dropped to his knees and dug with his fingertips. He pried the box out of the dirt, dusted it off, set it in the grass, and opened it.</p>
      
      <p>Wrapped in crumpled yellowing newspaper from 1963 was a tiny little crescent-shaped metal object. With the grin of a card shark he held it up to the light. It still glinted—no rust. Eight years, Rennie thought. Eight years of searching, and no one had found where he’d hidden it. Sweat beading on his forehead and neck made him shiver; he wiped it away.</p>
      
      <p>He clicked the clasp. It sprang open in his palm. All the bits and wires were still inside, and looking none the worse for wear. He knew nothing of how they functioned, and it made little difference to him. The men who wanted it, they would know. And they would pay handsomely. He felt a moment of gleaming satisfaction that, if he really had died, this secret would have been buried with him. You’d need a lot longer than eight years to outwit Charles Rennie. And you’d need a lot longer to put him out of the game. It was a delicate game, this international underhanded warfare, and there was nothing Rennie had ever loved better than lighting a stick of dynamite and throwing it onto the board.</p>

      <p align="right">1973</p>
      
      <p>Newt and Hermann argued again in the morning. Hermann wanted to tell Victor what he had found: The evidence of Orpheus’s work within Century, the erased files and transmissions. Newt said no, then he would have to explain why he had been looking, and give up Newt’s location. But Hermann insisted that coming clean now was the safest route.</p>
      
      <p>“They’re framing me, Hermann,” said Newt. “The Americans stole the transducer out from under them ten years ago. They want it back.”</p>
      
      <p>“The transatlantic intelligence alliance is <em>much </em>more valuable than one single piece of technology,” Hermann said, buttoning his shirt. “Even alien technology. Our government would never jeopardize it over something like this. Especially not when they were already getting it for free.”</p>
      
      <p>“Maybe not,” said Newt. “Maybe the whole fifth floor wouldn’t do this. But what about one person with a personal stake in this technology?”</p>
      
      <p>“What do you mean?”</p>
      
      <p>“Someone who, for example, was on the original mission. Someone like Becket.”</p>
      
      <p>Hermann frowned at the mirror.</p>
      
      <p>“He knew about Greenwich,” Newt said. “He was Birch’s <em>boss.</em> He knows everything he would have needed to orchestrate this, <em>and </em>he was at the conference. Why else would he do it?”</p>
      
      <p><em>And he ordered a leak check done on you, </em>Hermann neglected to add. He finished tying his tie and turned back to face Newt. “I don’t see why he would do it.”</p>
      
      <p>“What if he’s working with Rennie? What if they’ve been working together since the ‘60s?”</p>
      
      <p>“So then is Becket working for the Razvedka, or for the Division? Your theory makes no sense, Newton.”</p>
      
      <p>Newt made a frustrated noise and dropped his fist onto the bedspread.</p>
      
      <p>“Listen! If it’s not Becket, it’s someone else who has it out for me! If you tell them what we know, they’re going to come for me!”</p>
      
      <p>“But if you didn’t do it with malicious intent—”</p>
      
      <p>“They’re not going to see it that way! Someone upstairs is trying to hang me, Hermann! Don’t give them the rope to do it!”</p>
      
      <p>Hermann hesitated, unable to communicate his panic—he wanted this to stop, he wanted the hiding to be over, he wanted Newton to let him end it. And he wanted Newton to <em>want </em>it to end. He wanted Newton to <em>want to </em>come clean. Why didn’t he?</p>
      
      <p>“If I speak to Victor, if I tell him what we know, I think he would help—”</p>
      
      <p>“Help? Help? He’s already chomping at the bit to throw a mole in prison, and he already thinks it’s me! Have you <em>met </em>Victor? Have you forgotten the last ten years? He hates your guts. Okay? If you bring him all this, he’s going to throw <em>you</em> in jail for subterfuge before I have time to get to a border crossing!”</p>
      
      <p>Hermann waved his hand furiously, turning back away from Newt. “You don’t understand anything!”</p>
      
      <p>“Becket could even be working for Victor,” Newt muttered, not hearing him. “Maybe they’re in it together. To frame me. To get revenge on you.”</p>
      
      <p>“Don’t be stupid,” Hermann snapped into the mirror. “It wasn’t either of them, because they were both in that meeting.”</p>
      
      <p>“What?”</p>
      
      <p>“During the conference.”</p>
      
      <p>“Says them. They could be covering for each other.”</p>
      
      <p>“The times were recorded by the American Army guards. And the liaison was in that meeting too.”</p>
      
      <p>Newt dug the heels of his hands into his eyes, muttering something Hermann couldn’t hear.</p>
      
      <p>Hermann made one last plea. “The American envoys are coming in two days. If we say nothing, they’ll point the finger at you with or without evidence. Let me give them the evidence.”</p>
      
      <p>But Newt refused to agree.</p>
      
      <p>As Hermann left, he paused with his jacket on his arm and his hand on the door.</p>
      
      <p>“Newton,” he said. “Don’t leave.”</p>
      
      <p>Newt, sitting on the bed behind him, said nothing.</p>
      
      <p>“Please.”</p>
      
      <p>“I’m not a cat, Hermann,” Newt said coldly. “And I’m not your prisoner. You can’t tell me to sit on my hands and lock me up in your safe deposit box.”</p>
      
      <p>Hermann gave him one last look, and left.</p>
      
      <p>He walked more slowly than usual to the elevator. His hip and back ached from the twist last night. He thought of the night before. Of Newton’s dangerous testing, the way he had wanted to try it a second time. Hermann had declined out of fear—not the fear of what would happen if he tried again, but the fear of that desire.</p>
      
      <p>In the elevator, Hermann leaned on the railing. He noticed that his jacket fit strangely. He put his hand in the pocket, and felt an assortment of strange objects that were not his—he had taken Newton’s by mistake.</p>
      
      <p>He had no intention of going back. It would keep him warm in any case.</p>
      
      <p>But when he stepped out of the hotel, into the busy street, heavy sunlight and humid air bore down on him. The rain yesterday had washed the last of spring away.</p>
      
      <p>Summer had come.</p>
      
      <p align="center">*</p>
      
      <p>Weeks told him Vice Chief Victor was expecting his report on Orpheus after lunch. Hermann got to work with Wesley, robotically running the last batch of records through the IBM. In his mind he was busy organizing his story, how he would explain it all to Victor.</p>
      
      <p>
        <em>We didn’t find Orpheus, but he’s here among us, somewhere. Someone is rearranging the evidence to frame Dr. Geiszler. </em>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <em>And there’s something else you should know.</em>
      </p>
      
      <p>No one had caught it two years earlier when the message came through. But Hermann had. If he was the one to bring that message to Victor, maybe after all these years, Victor would forgive him.</p>
      
      <p>
        <em>Sir, you should know... Charles Rennie is alive. </em>
      </p>
      
      <p>Hermann was still organizing the story as he rode the elevator upstairs at 12:55. He’d been too nervous to eat lunch. He held the files in his arms, all of them duds. No match in the records.</p>
      
      <p>The lift, empty but for him, reached the fifth floor. The grate closed behind him, leaving him in the ever-underwhelming heart of Division upper management. It was just a hallway, white floor and a row of office doors with frosted glass. All were closed. It was dim and silent.</p>
      
      <p>Hermann walked down the corridor towards Robert Bowen’s old office. His blood was pumping like he was standing at the edge of a cliff. He turned the corner. Preston was waiting for him outside the door.</p>
      
      <p>“They’re ready for you,” Preston said. He rapped on the glass.</p>
      
      <p>“‘They’?” said Hermann.</p>
      
      <p>Preston, mouth twitching, took the armful of files from him as a voice behind the door said, “Come in.”</p>
      
      <p>Vice Chief Victor was standing at the window, looking out at the city street below. Sunlight blanketed the city, but the Vice Chief’s office faced north, so Century’s shadow fell before them. His hands were in his pockets. For one second, his casual stance filled Hermann with relief—he was going to tell him everything—the nightmare was about to end—</p>
      
      <p>And then the two men sitting opposite his desk turned to look at Hermann, and he saw others standing against the wall, smoking with their elbows on a cabinet. They were surrounded.</p>
      
      <p>“Dr. Gottlieb,” said Victor, taking the cigarette out of his mouth. “Thank you for coming upstairs to give your report on our man.”</p>
      
      <p>Hermann had no time to panic.</p>
      
      <p>“Please,” Victor was saying, gesturing to the remaining empty chair.</p>
      
      <p>“Thank you.”</p>
      
      <p>Hermann sat.</p>
      
      <p>The man next to him, a wispy older gentleman with a white tuft of hair, offered him a cigarette.</p>
      
      <p>“He doesn’t smoke,” said Victor.</p>
      
      <p>“Thank you,” Hermann said again.</p>
      
      <p>“Hermann, this is Mr. Hardwicke, and this is—”</p>
      
      <p>“Oscar,” said the other man, who was young, with chapped lips.</p>
      
      <p>“Good to meet you both,” Hermann said, shaking Hardwicke’s hand and nodding to Oscar, who nodded back.</p>
      
      <p>Hermann looked uneasily at the other men standing against the wall, but they received no introduction. One was tall and bald. The other was medium-height, late middle age, and unremarkable. Everyone had him at a disadvantage, except, somehow, Victor. Victor followed his uneasy glance at the other men, and looked at Hermann for a second before continuing.</p>
      
      <p>“I was hoping for your Orpheus report, Dr. Gottlieb, but I can see your hands are empty,” he said.</p>
      
      <p>“Yes, sir, we just finished processing the files you assigned to us. I wish I had better news.”</p>
      
      <p>“Or perhaps this is good news,” said Victor. “Perhaps this was a false alarm.”</p>
      
      <p><em>It wasn’t! </em>Hermann wanted to scream. But who the hell were these people? What were they doing here? What happened to their confidential internal investigation?</p>
      
      <p>“Perhaps,” Hermann managed. Suddenly he had an idea. “Signals analysis proved unsuccessful, but I would be willing to spend some time deciphering the messages—if they’re still graded high priority, that is.”</p>
      
      <p>Victor shook his head. “There isn’t time.”</p>
      
      <p>“Sir, the Blueberry has all the matching protocols and precedent codes up to ‘65. If you don’t want the Orpheus messages disseminated to the coding bay, or even GCHQ, I understand. But I could try, myself—it would only take a few days—”</p>
      
      <p>“No, no. Not now. We don’t have enough time. And we’re reasonably certain that the ‘Orpheus’ mole is the same person responsible for the—” He glanced at the spectators— “thefts this past weekend.”</p>
      
      <p>“Because of the signal sent out?”</p>
      
      <p>“That’s right.” Victor snubbed out his cigarette. “We’re focusing our efforts on catching the thief. We need this cleared up by Saturday. Preferably sooner.”</p>
      
      <p>“Two birds, as they say,” Hardwicke offered.</p>
      
      <p>“Of course,” said Hermann nervously. “Then am I... off this case?” <em>Why are you telling me this? </em>he thought, throwing another glance at the silent spectators.</p>
      
      <p>“Hardwicke and Oscar here are from Surveillance,” Victor said, standing up straighter and putting his hands into his pockets. Hermann wished he would sit down.</p>
      
      <p>“Oh.”</p>
      
      <p>“I’m in charge of the Gophers,” Hardwicke clarified with an apologetic smile. They were responsible for placing and monitoring bugs. “Many thanks to your lab for making our jobs easier and easier over the years. Hard to believe we’ve never met—I’d have thanked you sooner.”</p>
      
      <p>“I’m afraid I can’t take credit for most of that,” Hermann said, and then immediately regretted the allusion to his partner.</p>
      
      <p>“The radio delay jammer, in particular,” Hardwicke added. “Inspired.”</p>
      
      <p>“The what?” said Oscar.</p>
      
      <p>“The short-range signal delay jammer,” said Hardwicke, turning to his subordinate. “Delays the radio signals within a certain radius, they arrive a few minutes late. Oscar’s a bit green,” Hardwicke added to Hermann. “Marvelous thing. Just a couple minutes can really make a difference.”</p>
      
      <p>Victor cleared his throat, cutting Hardwicke off. “We have another set of names for you to run,” he said to Hermann. “A shorter list than before.”</p>
      
      <p>“Sir?”</p>
      
      <p>“Suspects,” said Victor, with a glance at the spectators. “You haven’t heard from Dr. Geiszler yet, I take it?”</p>
      
      <p>Hermann swallowed, his mouth having gone dry, and shook his head.</p>
      
      <p>“I’m afraid he’s on this list,” said Victor. “As well as everyone else who was at the conference. Most of them weren’t on the original list. But anyone who was at the conference is now a suspect.”</p>
      
      <p>“Ah.”</p>
      
      <p>“But,” said Victor.</p>
      
      <p>Hardwicke’s voice took him by surprise. “But I’m afraid Oscar here has some additional testimony you should know of.”</p>
      
      <p>Hermann turned. The boy’s ears were bright red.</p>
      
      <p>“I’m in street surveillance,” Oscar said, eyes fixed on Victor’s ashtray. “Sometimes I’m assigned to watch... ex-employees.” Oscar glanced at Victor. “This is confidential policy, sir,” he added, to Hermann, as if resentful that he had to confess it. “Well as it happened, I was out and about yesterday, off duty, and I saw an ex-employee speaking with a… missing employee.” Oscar twisted his hands together. “Caitlin Lightcap, Research, terminated 1963. Newton Geiszler was speaking with her in an alley.”</p>
      
      <p>Hermann’s blood ran cold. <em>And we saw you there too. You’ve been lying to us. These men are here to arrest you.</em></p>
      
      <p>“And what did you do, Oscar?” said Hardwicke encouragingly.</p>
      
      <p>“R—reported, sir,” managed Oscar. “Hurried to the phone. Even though I was off duty. He’s graded high-priority. By the time I could get back, though, she was alone again. Then she played a show with her rock band.”</p>
      
      <p>“I—” Hermann was in total confusion, he had lost any concept of strategy. “The two of them are friends. They have been for many years. They play in that band together regularly.”</p>
      
      <p>He turned to Victor.</p>
      
      <p>“If he’s still in the country, that’s a good sign, isn’t it?”</p>
      
      <p>“Unless he’s working with Lightcap,” said Victor, and he actually looked pained.</p>
      
      <p>“But she isn’t under suspicion too, is—?”</p>
      
      <p>“Not your concern.”</p>
      
      <p>Hermann turned. The nondescript man had spoken.</p>
      
      <p>He turned back to Victor. Victor stared at him in a way that said, <em>Don’t. </em></p>
      
      <p>“It’s paramount that we catch him—the thief—before the CIA envoys arrive from Langley on Saturday,” said Victor. “We haven’t much time left.”</p>
      
      <p>He put his hand down on the stack of files on his desk. The name on top was <em>Becket, Raleigh.</em></p>
      
      <p>“Is Becket a suspect—sir?”</p>
      
      <p>Victor nodded.</p>
      
      <p>“Everyone who was at the conference,” he repeated. “We need you to run them all. Hermann,” he said. “I’m sorry. I’ve taken a preliminary glance, and I can tell you... There’s an Orpheus message from D.C., fall 1971. On this list, Dr. Geiszler is the only person who was on that trip. I was on it with him. As far as our records are concerned, I don’t know that anyone else could have sent that message.”</p>
      
      <p>Victor was looking at him, his expression terribly sad.</p>
      
      <p>This wasn’t a trap, Hermann realized.</p>
      
      <p>“I’m sorry,” Victor said. “I didn’t want to see it turn out this way.”</p>
      
      <p>This was not a trap for Hermann—if they wanted him, they could have arrested him on any charge they wished. But they wanted him on their side. They wanted to use him to get to Newt.</p>
      
      <p>They would do that if they were certain. Certain that he was the mole.</p>
      
      <p>“The best thing you can do for Dr. Geiszler now is to tell us all you know.”</p>
      
      <p>“But I don’t know anything,” Hermann said, willing himself to look at no one but Victor. “I’m sorry.”</p>
      
      <p align="center">*</p>
      
      <p>Wesley was already in the computer bay when Hermann entered. “Weeks said we had more names to run,” he said. “I wanted to help.”</p>
      
      <p>Wesley looked at Hermann’s face more closely than he ever had before. Hermann wondered what he saw there. He found he didn’t want to turn away or tell Wesley to leave. The switch in his feelings towards the man had been complete.</p>
      
      <p>“Thank you,” he said, voice hoarse.</p>
      
      <p>Becket’s file was first, and a disappointment. Most of the Orpheus messages were from London, and Becket had been in Vienna many of those dates. But there was one thing—he had been on the Langley trip with Newton. Why hadn’t Victor mentioned that? Had he forgotten? Or overlooked it? Hermann marked Becket down as indeterminate.</p>
      
      <p>After a string of mismatches, they reached Geiszler.</p>
      
      <p>Wesley looked at Hermann.</p>
      
      <p>“No point delaying, is there?” said Wesley bravely.</p>
      
      <p>Hermann shook his head.</p>
      
      <p>“I can do it,” Wesley offered.</p>
      
      <p>“It’s all right,” Hermann said. He entered the numbers.</p>
      
      <p>The IBM hummed smoothly. The dot matrix began to print.</p>
      
      <p>Wesley hurried down the computer bay while Hermann stood, frozen to the spot. It wasn’t a match, of course. They were wrong. It wasn’t Newton.</p>
      
      <p>“But it’s a match!”</p>
      
      <p>Wesley looked back at Hermann in horror.</p>
      
      <p>“But it can’t be!” said Wesley.</p>
      
      <p>Hermann unfroze. He limped over, and took the papers from Wesley’s hands.</p>
      
      <p>“There must be a mistake,” Wesley said as Hermann scanned the records. Travel records. Each matching entry was highlighted in gray.</p>
      
      <p>June, 1973: Newton was at the Estate the weekend of the Orpheus message from East Anglia.</p>
      
      <p>May, 1973: Newton was in London, Orpheus was in London.</p>
      
      <p>April, 1973: Newton was in London, Orpheus was in London.</p>
      
      <p>April, 1973: Newton was at a workshop in Yorkshire. So was Orpheus.</p>
      
      <p>London, February, 1973. Oxford, December, 1972. London, October, 1972. Glasgow, August, 1972. London, June, 1972. London, May, 1972. Oxford, February, 1972. January, 1972. December, 1971.</p>
      
      <p>October, 1971: He was in Langley the same weekend that Orpheus signaled from Virginia.</p>
      
      <p>September, 1971: He was at home, in London, when the first Orpheus message was sent out.</p>
      
      <p>Every Orpheus entry was a match.</p>
      
      <p>“No,” Hermann muttered. It was impossible.</p>
      
      <p>“It must be a mistake,” Wesley said again.</p>
      
      <p>“Look,” said Hermann, finding something. “Look at this.” The IBM had printed Newt’s full travel records for all time. “These records say Newton was at the Estate the weekend of the Bowen affair. In East Anglia. But he wasn’t. I know he was in London.” <em>Or so he told me. </em>“His record is inaccurate.”</p>
      
      <p>“Or it’s been altered,” Wesley said.</p>
      
      <p>Hermann nodded quickly. Mostly to himself.</p>
      
      <p>“Wesley, I’ve got to make a phone call.”</p>
      
      <p>In a phone booth five blocks from the office, Hermann called the hotel. He was sweating in Newton’s ill-fitting jacket. It was hotter than a greenhouse in the little glass box. The hotel put him through to his room. The phone rang and rang. There was no reply.</p>
      
      <p>Frantically, Hermann hung up and redialed. He asked to be put through to the other room.</p>
      
      <p>No answer.</p>
      
      <p>He slammed the phone down and cursed. “Dammit. God dammit!”</p>
      
      <p>He pressed the heels of his hands into his eyes. Where was he? Had he gone?</p>
      
      <p>But it was impossible. Newton was not a double agent. And he was in no state to travel.</p>
      
      <p>No, Hermann realized with sudden hope. Newton was far too unwell to go anywhere. And he didn’t even have his wallet. Hermann had it. He couldn’t get anywhere, even if he wanted to.</p>
      
      <p>Hermann was out of coins. On a last ditch hope, he made a collect call to Newton’s flat. There was no reply there either.</p>
      
      <p>He returned to Century drenched in sweat. He took the Orpheus file from the IBM bay and went back to the lab. He took his keys from his desk, walked out the back of the lab, through two locked doors, and into a dark, dusty room. He turned on the light. It had been a while since he’d visited the Blueberry.</p>
      
      <p>They had originally built the computer to detect OTP matches. Later on, they had added other matching protocols, as he’d said to Victor. Orpheus’s cipher was not OTP. There was a small chance the cipher, whatever it was, had been used by the Soviets before. If the Blueberry had it in its databanks, it would tell Hermann. It wouldn’t decipher it for him, but it would be a place to start.</p>
      
      <p>He shut the door behind him and began to enter the data.</p>
