    <h1>
    11. Signal Match
    </h1>
      
      <p>NEWT WAS TIRED. Tired of flipping between BBC 1 and BBC 2. Tired of this carpet. Tired of this headache. Tired of the vague dizziness, the distant ringing. It was louder today. Most of all he was tired of having nothing to do.</p>
      
      <p>He heard footsteps in the hall and looked up. They stopped right outside his door. Cursing, Newt scrambled up, made unsteadily for the closet, and dove inside. He wedged himself into the dark back corner, head spinning. He listened hard, panting, hand cupped around his good ear. Then the footsteps shuffled onward. He heard a squeaky wheel.</p>
      
      <p>It was the housekeeper.</p>
      
      <p>He slumped back against the scratchy spare blankets. False alarm. Of course. Housekeeper. <em>Obviously</em>.</p>
      
      <p>He closed his eyes. The ringing vibrated in his ear canal.</p>
      
      <p><em>How did you get here? </em>he asked himself.</p>
      
      <p><em>You acted stupid, and now you’re acting stupider, </em>answered the voice in his head.</p>
      
      <p><em>Yeah, </em>he thought. <em>Sounds about right.</em></p>
      
      <p>Why had he done it? At the time, it had simply seemed the thing to do—the natural next step in the transmitter investigation. He wasn’t sure he regretted it, still, but a new dread was growing as he confronted a consequence not previously considered.</p>
      
      <p>Treason was one thing. But he was starting to consider that this incident might have been bona fide professional suicide.</p>
      
      <p>If Hermann couldn’t prove he was being framed—which was tough, when he was 100% guilty—he was, at the least, probably going to lose his job.</p>
      
      <p>And why? What for? Why throw a stick of dynamite into the works of a 20-year engineering career? He thought of Langley.</p>
      
      <p>Newt took off his glasses and rubbed the bridge of his nose, closing his eyes. Solitary confinement was going to drive him crazy.</p>
      
      <p>He crawled out of the closet and got back on his feet. He rubbed his rug-burned hands together, then made his way to the phone. He dialed Caitlin Lightcap’s work number.</p>
      
      <p>The phone stopped mid-ring and a voice said “Lightcap.”</p>
      
      <p>“Yello.”</p>
      
      <p>“Hey kid,” she said, voice warming. “How’ve you been?”</p>
      
      <p>Newt flopped back on the bedspread and looked up at the ceiling. “Oh, me? Never mind about me. How are you, chum?”</p>
      
      <p>“Just peachy, pal,” she said.</p>
      
      <p>“Tell me about your day.”</p>
      
      <p>“Same old,” she said, and he heard the sound of a hole punch. “We still on for tonight?”</p>
      
      <p>“Tonight?” He groaned. “Oh, shit. It’s Tuesday.”</p>
      
      <p>“You forget what day of the week it is?”</p>
      
      <p>Newt was rubbing his eyes frustratedly. “No—yes—God—dammit.”</p>
      
      <p>They had practice tonight. He'd forgotten completely. And he couldn’t go, because he was in hotel prison. Newt hated letting the girls down—especially Caitlin. The band was one of the few bright spots in her life.</p>
      
      <p>He heard her sigh angrily on the other end. “Well, yes. The rumors are true. It is Tuesday. And we have practice.”</p>
      
      <p>Newt said nothing.</p>
      
      <p>“Right?”</p>
      
      <p>“Right...”</p>
      
      <p>“Look, man, if you’re cancelling on us, just say so.”</p>
      
      <p>“No, no—” Newt winced, feeling the full weight of his obligation to her. “Yeah, I’m really, really sorry, but I won’t be able to make it...”</p>
      
      <p>There was a long silence on the line. Newt’s dread grew with every second.</p>
      
      <p>“Man—I’m sorry,” he said, overwhelmed with the feeling that he let everyone down, without fail. “Really, it’s just that some stuff has come up, and I can’t really get out right now... I’m sorry, I’ll make it up to you, I just—”</p>
      
      <p>There was a sound as she stopped sucking her teeth.</p>
      
      <p>“Lightcap?”</p>
      
      <p>“Yeah?”</p>
      
      <p>Her voice was still tense.</p>
      
      <p>“Can you do me a favor?”</p>
      
      <p>“A favor?”</p>
      
      <p>“Can I borrow a guitar?”</p>
      
      <p>“A <em>guitar</em>? What’s wrong with yours?”</p>
      
      <p>“For practice.”</p>
      
      <p>“Did your goddamn house burn down? Is that what’s going on?”</p>
      
      <p>“Ha—no. No, I kind of wish, but no, I just need to...”</p>
      
      <p>Some tone in his disappointed laugh tipped her off. Her voice turned on a dime.</p>
      
      <p>“Need to what? I’ll bring it over. The guitar. No problem. Just tell me where.”</p>
      
      <p>He gave the name of the hotel. “Room 237. Just leave it at the reception desk.”</p>
      
      <p>“All right. I will. Should I cancel the gig tomorrow?”</p>
      
      <p>“Maybe,” Newt said sadly. “Well, maybe not. I don’t know. Do you mind singing?”</p>
      
      <p>“If you don’t show up? We’ll manage. Up to you, really.”</p>
      
      <p>Newt chewed his lip.</p>
      
      <p>“I’ll call you.”</p>
      
      <p>“All right.”</p>
      
      <p>“I want to come. I’ll try to come. We should talk.”</p>
      
      <p>“Ominous.”</p>
      
      <p>Newt said nothing.</p>
      
      <p>“I’ll drop the guitar off after work,” she said. “Don’t get any scratches on it.”</p>
      
      <p>“I won’t.”</p>
      
      <p>“And don’t do anything weird with it.”</p>
      
      <p>“Weird? Me?”</p>
      
      <p>“I’ll tell Laurie and Vivian. We’ll see you tomorrow. Or maybe not.”</p>
      
      <p>“Thanks. You’re the best.”</p>
      
      <p>“I know. Take it easy, kid.”</p>
      
      <p>“Bye.”</p>
      
      <p>Caitlin rang off, and Newt listened to the dial tone for another moment before hanging up too.</p>
      
      <p align="center">*</p>
      
      <p>“Newton, where in God’s name did you get that?”</p>
      
      <p>Newt stopped strumming the guitar. The door to their room closed behind Hermann with an ominous click.</p>
      
      <p>“Good afternoon to you too,” Newt said, not turning as Hermann came in. “Or is it evening? I’ve lost track of the time.”</p>
      
      <p>“I told you <em>not</em> to leave this room,” Hermann said to Newt’s back, as Newt sighed and closed his eyes. He heard no sound of Hermann taking his jacket off or putting his bag down. That meant he wanted a fight. “I know you don’t take threats to your safety seriously, but <em>I </em>do, and if <em>you </em>don’t—”</p>
      
      <p>“Hermann! I didn’t leave the goddamn room, all right?” Newt said, setting the guitar down with a hollow twang. “I had it delivered. Will you settle down?”</p>
      
      <p>“Delivered by whom?”</p>
      
      <p>“Caitlin! She brought it over, left it at the desk, and then someone brought it up to the room. I’ve been in here. All day. Nobody has laid eyes on my precious face. How exactly do you plan on moving hotels? Will we be traveling in secret tunnels, Dr. Gottlieb?”</p>
      
      <p>Hermann closed his eyes and sighed through his nose, dropping his briefcase onto the carpet. “Yes. We’re going. I’ve booked the rooms. Collect your things. I’ll call a cab.”</p>
      
      <p>He went into the bathroom and shut the door. Newt heard the tap turn on.</p>
      
      <p>“It’s boring as shit being in hiding, you know that, Hermann?” Newt said to the closed door. “And you know, I was actually looking forward to finally <em>talking</em> to someone, after being by myself all day. And instead what I get is <em>scolded</em>. I had absolutely nothing to do until—”</p>
      
      <p>The door reopened.</p>
      
      <p>“The walls here are extremely thin,” said Hermann with condescending evenness. “I could hear you playing from the lift. I suggest you quiet down.”</p>
      
      <p>Newt sighed frustratedly and stood up. He put the guitar into its hard-backed case and shut it with excessive force. He dropped his arms to his sides.</p>
      
      <p>“There. Packed.”</p>
      
      <p>Hermann spared him a glance, infuriatingly blank, and went to the phone to call down to the concierge for a taxi. Newt stalked into the bathroom and retrieved their toothbrushes.</p>
      
      <p>A short, silent cab ride brought them to their new temporary home, a tall, bland hotel with a prefabricated lobby full of hideously colored mid-century seating. The rooms themselves were less offensive, carpeted and upholstered in various shades of gunmetal gray. They had a connected pair of rooms, better appointed than the single room they’d left: each had a full-size bed, a sofa, a television, a radio, an A/C unit, a desk with an anglepoise lamp, and wide windows overlooking the busy street. It was a clear, cool day; the sun had sunk behind buildings already, leaving an empty blue sky.</p>
      
      <p>Newt could tell that Hermann’s investigations today had gone poorly, but Hermann refused to explain anything until Newt had searched the new room for listening devices. While he did so, Hermann unpacked the sparse luggage he had bought—a few changes of clothes, razors, soap.</p>
      
      <p>“All clear?” Hermann asked when Newt returned from the adjoining room.</p>
      
      <p>“Yeah,” Newt said. He frowned at the clothes Hermann had bought for him, still packed into the bag on his bed. Did Hermann want him take his things into the other bedroom?</p>
      
      <p>“What? You disapprove of my choices?”</p>
      
      <p>“No,” said Newt, unsure if a fight was coming, and ambivalent about starting one. “I mean, probably. But—you had time to pick all <em>this</em> up, but not to go to the bank and get my transmitter?”</p>
      
      <p>Hermann stubbornly avoided Newt’s eyes. “This was more important,” he said.</p>
      
      <p>Newt sighed.</p>
      
      <p>“Do you want me to take my stuff into the other room and sleep there?”</p>
      
      <p>“What?”</p>
      
      <p>Newt frowned at Hermann.</p>
      
      <p>“No—I only booked two for—appearances. Of course not.”</p>
      
      <p>Mollified, Newt nodded. Hermann felt a stab of guilt for giving Newt such a cold shoulder. Hermann sat down at the desk, leaning his cane against it, and looked at the couch. Newt sat down on it.</p>
      
      <p>“I think Victor is right,” Hermann said. “I think there’s a mole in the Division.”</p>
      
      <p>Hermann told him what he’d learned—or, for the most part, not learned—in the office that day.</p>
      
      <p>“So you think someone scrubbed Birch’s file, and the 2TP,” Newt said. “The same person.”</p>
      
      <p>“Yes,” said Hermann.</p>
      
      <p>“A mole.”</p>
      
      <p>“Yes.”</p>
      
      <p>“It could be institutional,” Newt pointed out. “Birch was a scandal. All that was patched up. This file could just be another patch.”</p>
      
      <p>Hermann shook his head. “He knew about Greenwich. What Stella said—”</p>
      
      <p>“Yeah, yeah. I guess.”</p>
      
      <p>“And what about the 2TP? What reason would the fifth floor have to hide that?”</p>
      
      <p>“The Greenwich connection?” Newt suggested.</p>
      
      <p>Hermann shook his head. “There’s something else in that message.”</p>
      
      <p>Newt was still frowning, unconvinced.</p>
      
      <p>“How are you feeling?” Hermann asked into the silence. “How’s your ear?”</p>
      
      <p>“Ear? It’s all right,” Newt lied. The ringing was worse, but it was nothing to worry about. He didn’t want to set Hermann’s alarm bells off.</p>
      
      <p>“Are you still dizzy?”</p>
      
      <p>“Off and on.”</p>
      
      <p>“Is it worse?”</p>
      
      <p>“About the same,” Newt said with persistent optimism.</p>
      
      <p>Hermann frowned and looked away out the window, at the high-rise across the street. Its many windows were reflecting the setting sun. Newt slouched back, wrapping his arms around his knees.</p>
      
      <p>“I want to know who the Abteilung’s new British source is,” Hermann said, half to himself. “Who sold them the transmitter. I wanted that 2TP message. I wanted to decipher it.”</p>
      
      <p>Newt glanced at him.</p>
      
      <p>“What about asking me?”</p>
      
      <p>Hermann looked at Newt. “Asking you what?”</p>
      
      <p>“For the transmission.”</p>
      
      <p>Hermann stared at him.</p>
      
      <p>Newt raised his eyebrows.</p>
      
      <p>“Do you <em>remember</em> it?” Hermann said in shock.</p>
      
      <p>“<em>Yes,</em>” said Newt, as if Hermann were the densest person he’d ever met. “Obviously!”</p>
      
      <p>“And when exactly were you planning on <em>telling </em>me—?”</p>
      
      <p>“Oh my god, Hermann, just give me the notepad.” He stood up, and tugged Hermann’s arm. Hermann surrendered the desk chair. “Of course I remember it. Hello? Human Xerox? How can you forget this so often, Hermann, God. You don’t even care about my stupendous brain. You only love me for my body.”</p>
      
      <p>Hermann watched in amazement as Newt closed his eyes and began to scribble letters in groups of five onto the notepad, his hand moving feverishly.</p>
      
      <p>“The groups don’t actually...”</p>
      
      <p>“Shut up.”</p>
      
      <p>“...matter,” Hermann finished. “And did you see the matched transmission as well?”</p>
      
      <p>“Yes, yes,” said Newt, tearing a page off and continuing on the next. “It was September 1950.”</p>
      
      <p>Hermann watched him fill a third and then a fourth page.</p>
      
      <p>“Done,” said Newt. “And the match...” He began transcribing the matching message.</p>
      
      <p>“Newton,” said Hermann. “Are you in the habit of memorizing all the OTP transmissions that the Blueberry processes?”</p>
      
      <p>“Everyone’s got a hobby,” Newt said, still writing. “No—I mean, yes. Only the matches. I usually take a look.”</p>
      
      <p>“Why on Earth?”</p>
      
      <p>“Are you seriously complaining about it right now?”</p>
      
      <p>Hermann opened his mouth to retort. Again it occurred to him how much sensitive information was stored inside of Newton’s head.</p>
      
      <p>A few minutes later, Newt tore the last page off triumphantly. He put both sets together and handed them up to Hermann. “Done,” he said. “Can you do anything with these? Or do you need to take them to your buddy Stella?”</p>
      
      <p>Hermann looked offended. “I may be a <em>bit</em> rusty, but I can still handle a matched set of <em>Vigenère </em>ciphers, I should think.”</p>
      
      <p>“They’re OTP, Hermann. There’s no key.”</p>
      
      <p>“Yes, there is. It’s just long. But when you have two messages, it isn’t hard. It just takes a bit of time.”</p>
      
      <p>“Fine, then, if you’re so smart.” Newt stood up to offer the chair, then grabbed the edge of the desk. “Ugh—too fast.”</p>
      
      <p>Hermann steadied his arm. “Are you all right?”</p>
      
      <p>“I’m fine,” Newt said, opening his eyes. “I’m fine. Sit. Decode.”</p>
      
      <p>Hermann sat. “Decipher,” he corrected, putting on his glasses.</p>
      
      <p>Newt rolled his eyes and sat back on the couch. Hermann leaned intently over the messages. “And the first message—do you remember where it came from?”</p>
      
      <p>“Hamburg. Embassy message, I think.”</p>
      
      <p>“Lucky,” Hermann muttered. So both messages were in German. He squinted, then took off his glasses and cleaned them with his tie. It had been a while since he’d done an OTP by hand. He put his glasses back on and started writing out a Vigenère Square.</p>
      
      <p>In the long, underhanded history of cryptography, an uncrackable cipher is the holy grail. A cipher that can only be read by the sender and the recipient. The onetime pad system is, in a vacuum, that cipher. It cannot be deciphered.</p>
      
      <p>The OTP is descended from the Vigenère Cipher, a fairly secure form of enciphering. The cipher is created using a Vigenère Square, a grid of 26 alphabets resembling a multiplication or addition table. The first alphabet starts with A (A=a, B=b, C=c... Z=z), the second with B, (B=a, C=b, D=c... A=z) and so on, until Z (Z=a, A=b, B=c...Y=z).</p>
      
      <p align="center"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/09a78f0dedaefe6f91b68fccff671933/tumblr_inline_pyis7tORCO1wz4yuf_500.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="500" align="middle" /> </p>
      
      <p>Each letter of the message is encoded according to a ‘key,’ a prearranged word. Each letter of this key corresponds to a line in the Vigenère Square. So, in an enciphered message, the first letter of the message corresponds to the first letter of the keyword: if the keyword is, say, “NEWTON,” the sender encodes the first letter according the “N” alphabet, the second in the “E” alphabet, and so on, repeating the keyword as many times as necessary.</p>
      
      <p align="center"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/6672a4e519cedd4fc78de88ddaca093b/tumblr_inline_pyitodUdS11wz4yuf_500.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="500" /> </p>
      
      <p>Because each letter is encoded from a different alphabet, the cipher is extremely difficult to decrypt. But not impossible. The repetition of the keyword is what makes it vulnerable. A clever cryptanalyst can discover the length of the keyword and then analyze the frequency of letters in the message to unravel it.</p>
      
      <p>The onetime pad solves the key problem: instead of a repeating key, the message is encoded using a key the same length as the message. And the key is a random set of letters. This random set of letters is distributed on a pad of paper to <em>only</em> two people. They can then exchange completely secure messages, <em>only </em>to one another, <em>only </em>using each key once. Each letter is encoded on a random line of the Vigenère Square, and the intercepter is never the wiser. It is genuinely unbreakable.</p>
      
      <p>Unless the same key is used more than once.</p>
      
      <p>Perhaps perfect cryptographical methods exist, but perfect organizations do not. The Razvedka’s accidental duplicate set of keypads made their messages vulnerable to attack. It was this weakness that Newt and Hermann’s Blueberry computer exploited. But Hermann didn’t need a computer to help him decipher two matched messages. All he needed was a Vigenère Square.</p>
      
      <p>Hermann was familiarizing himself with the two messages, planning his strategy. Now they were just a patternless set of letters. But soon, he would pry them apart.</p>
      
      <p>He started with a crib. A crib is a word the analyst assumes to be present in the ciphertext—usually a common word, like “the,” or a name, or a day of the week.</p>
      
      <p>Hermann knew that this message was in German, and he knew when it was sent, so it probably contained the word <em> Juli </em> (July). The first letter of the ciphertext was “N.” Assuming that this represented “J,” he reverse-Vigenèred the letter and found that it corresponded to the “E” alphabet. He repeated this with the next three letters, acting as though they spelled out “JULI.” Then he turned his attention to the first message. The two messages shared a random key; assuming that his crib was correct, then he knew the first four alphabets in that key. So he tried the first four letters of the ciphertext according to his key. They revealed “BZKD.” Probably not correct. He started over. Assume that “Juli” starts at the <em> second </em>letter... </p>
      
      <p>Newt lay on the couch, staring at nothing, listening to the scratching of Hermann’s pen. After a few moments he heard another crossing-out, and heard Hermann sigh to himself. He turned to look up. He was staring at the messages with blank focus Newt recognized. He saw a less intense rendition of it every Sunday over the crossword. It was the total focus of the puzzlemaster. The hotel would have to catch fire or collapse before Hermann took notice.</p>
      
      <p>So Newt got up and took the guitar into the other room to practice. As he was closing the door between their rooms, Hermann said:</p>
      
      <p>“You can leave it open.”</p>
      
      <p>Newt paused.</p>
      
      <p>“The door?”</p>
      
      <p>“Yes. If you’re going to play.”</p>
      
      <p>Newt smiled. “Sure.”</p>
      
      <p align="center">*</p>
      
      <p>An hour or so later, Newt was hungry. He didn’t hear anything from the other room, so he set the guitar down, took the notepad from his desk, and checked on Hermann.</p>
      
      <p>His partner was standing in front of the window, stretching. The desk was entirely covered in papers.</p>
      
      <p>“Hey,” said Newt, approaching with the notepad. “Thought you might need a spare.”</p>
      
      <p>“Thank you. I will soon.” Hermann set it on the desk. “I was just taking a break.”</p>
      
      <p>“It looks like it’s going well,” Newt said. “Did you find a crib?”</p>
      
      <p>Hermann nodded. “I have the first few words.”</p>
      
      <p>“Impressive.”</p>
      
      <p>Hermann shrugged modestly, leaning back against the edge of the desk. He began to loosen his tie.</p>
      
      <p>“It’s nothing too complex, once you get going.”</p>
      
      <p>Newt smiled wryly. “Right. Nothing <em>too </em>complex.”</p>
      
      <p>Hermann returned his version of a smile, eyes flicking down. “I’ll have it all by morning,” he said.</p>
      
      <p>“But you’re taking a break?” Newt said, moving a little closer. “Right?”</p>
      
      <p>“That’s right.”</p>
      
      <p>“May I?”</p>
      
      <p>Hermann dropped his hands to let Newt take over tie-untying duties.</p>
      
      <p>“You’re too kind.”</p>
      
      <p>“The pleasure’s all mine, Dr. Gottlieb,” said Newt, unbuttoning his collar and pulling the tie free. He tossed it aside with a flourish that made Hermann laugh. Then he slid his hands under Hermann’s jacket, around his waist, and kissed him.</p>
      
      <p>Newt pushed Hermann back so he sat on the desk. Hermann made some noises of objection as several papers slid off, but Newt kept him quiet. He pushed Hermann’s jacket off and threw it aside onto the couch.</p>
      
      <p>Hermann leaned back for a second of air. Newt secured his position between Hermann’s knees and started playing with the straps of his suspenders.</p>
      
      <p>“You know it’s 1973, right? Not 1913?” he said as Hermann took his glasses off, chain and all, and set them on the desk.</p>
      
      <p>“Braces are more secure,” Hermann said primly.</p>
      
      <p>“I’ll show <em>you</em> secure,” Newt said under his chin, pushing the suspenders back off his shoulders. Hermann exhaled.</p>
      
      <p>“Darling—please, watch the papers.”</p>
      
      <p>“What could be sexier than a little national security risk?” Newt said, while Hermann ran his hands through Newt’s hair.</p>
      
      <p>“Many—things,” managed Hermann, distracted.</p>
      
      <p>“Mm,” Newt said into his ear, and nipped it.</p>
      
      <p>“Newton...” Hermann said a few minutes and a few buttons later. “I’m not—excuse me—I am not having sex with you on this desk.”</p>
      
      <p>“What?” Newt pulled back. “You’re no fun.”</p>
      
      <p>“You’re an idiot,” said Hermann, too breathless to sound believably annoyed. He gave him a light push on the sternum. “I have work to do.”</p>
      
      <p>Newt scoffed, and kissed him again before letting go. “I’m starving. Maybe human computers don’t need to eat, but engineers do. I’m going downstairs.”</p>
      
      <p>“To the restaurant?” Hermann said, looking up anxiously from his shirt buttons.</p>
      
      <p>“Yes,” said Newt, taking over buttoning. “It’s fine. It’s late. It’ll be empty. And you should eat too.”</p>
      
      <p>Hermann had been successfully put at ease; he acquiesced. They ate in the hotel restaurant. A few solo businessmen were scattered among the tables, eating or drinking alone, and there was one family—two parents with their college-age child, looking uncomfortable on the verge of adulthood. Newt made charming chatter with the lone waiter. They stuck out like a sore thumb, Hermann knew: they looked incongruous together, uncategorizable as a pair. They would have been safer at odds, or separated. But their familiarity was, by now, impossible to hide.</p>
      
      <p>Hermann watched Newt telling the waiter that, yes, in fact, astronauts could one day grow crops on the moon, and would. Somehow in the prefabricated restaurant with its white tablecloths and chintzy carpet, the mass-production with the gaudy veneer of class, the space felt too unreal for anything to befall them.</p>
      
      <p>“So, okay. All right,” Newt said, sitting back. He took off his glasses, rubbed his face, ran a hand through his already disorderly hair, and put his palms together. Eyes closed, he said. “So. 1963, UFO crashes.”</p>
      
      <p>Newt opened his eyes, reached across the table, and dragged Hermann’s abandoned plate over. He picked up his untouched bread roll.</p>
      
      <p>“UFO. Crashes in Germany.” He dropped the roll onto the plate. “Abteilung takes it to Wagner. It contains <em>some form </em>of valuable technology. They extract it, do science all over it. Make it a workable input-output. Becket breaks in, steals one part.”</p>
      
      <p>He tore the bun in half and held one half up.</p>
      
      <p>“The transmitter,” Hermann said.</p>
      
      <p>“The transmitter. You go to pick it up. It’s gone. <em>Someone </em>has stolen it, hidden it somewhere.” He tucked the ‘transmitter’ half under the rim of the plate. “Transmitter is now MIA.</p>
      
      <p>“Bowen disaster breaks. Some unknown time afterwards, we presume, the U.S.A. extracts the output half, the transducer.”</p>
      
      <p>He removed the remaining bread piece from the plate.</p>
      
      <p>“Years go by. The Americans are R&amp;D-ing the transducer. The transmitter is still MIA. Separated, and never the twain shall meet.</p>
      
      <p>“Then in 1971, Abetilung finds someone in Germany. This guy’s got the transmitter. Same guy who originally stashed it? Someone who bought it? We don’t know. He—or she—sends an encoded message, reusing the onetime code pad—”</p>
      
      <p>“Cipher.”</p>
      
      <p>“Cipher, whatever, yes, the cipher pad. We intercept their message, process it in the Blueberry.”</p>
      
      <p>Hermann nodded. “Yes.”</p>
      
      <p>Newt retrieved the first piece of bread and put it back onto the plate. “So. He sells the transmitter to ‘em. Soviets finally get it back. Then the Raz call in Tovarish Greenwich. They renew their studies with vigor. Then Greenwich gets cold feet, calls up Becket. Shares his research with the Brits.”</p>
      
      <p>Newt squished the bread up and held it in his right hand.</p>
      
      <p>“Meanwhile,” he said, placing the excluded half back onto the plate, “the U.S.A. brings their completed transducer over to the U.K. to complete the set, but then some shmuck steals it and gets it stuck in his ear.”</p>
      
      <p>He picked that piece up too, and held it in his left hand.</p>
      
      <p>Both hands out, he looked up at Hermann expectantly. Hermann nodded.</p>
      
      <p>“All correct.”</p>
      
      <p>“So what <em>is </em>it, Hermann? What is it? What does it <em>do</em>?”</p>
      
      <p>“I don’t know.”</p>
      
      <p>Newt opened the ‘transmitter’ half in his fist slowly, and, holding them both out, raised his eyebrows insinuatingly at Hermann.</p>
      
      <p>Hermann caught his meaning.</p>
      
      <p>“We will not find out via trial and error inside your skull.”</p>
      
      <p>“Come <em>on</em>. We have both components. We’re the first people to have both components in ten <em>years</em>.”</p>
      
      <p>Hermann was shaking his head. “Absolutely not. We have no idea what it will do to you.”</p>
      
      <p>“What’s the worst it could do? Kill me? Well do you know what <em>not knowing</em> is doing to me? It’s killing me. I’m dying, Hermann.”</p>
      
      <p>“I’m sure,” said Hermann briskly, sliding his plate back towards himself. “But you’re wrong on one count. We <em>don’t </em>have both components. The transmitter is at the bank.”</p>
      
      <p>“Then get it.”</p>
      
      <p>“And I’m certain the transducer is affecting your hearing,” said Hermann, taking both halves of bread from Newt’s outstretched hands, “because I just said <em>no. </em>Twice.”</p>
      
      <p>Newt dropped his hands into his lap with an annoyed sound as Hermann put them back on his plate and sat back.</p>
      
      <p>“Why won’t you let me test the two components? That transmitter is mine. Technically.”</p>
      
      <p>“I don’t approve of self-experimentation,” said Hermann.</p>
      
      <p>“Well sorry about your <em>principles, </em>Hermann,” said Newt, “But this is the best lead we’ve got, and you know it.”</p>
      
      <p>Hermann looked at him. Why did he feel so reluctant to return Newton’s transmitter to him?</p>
      
      <p>Instead of answering, Hermann picked up half of the torn bread and ate it.</p>
      
      <p>“You used to flatter me so much,” Newt said, leaning back in his chair. “Back in Menwith Hill. I miss those days.”</p>
      
      <p>“I’m sure you do,” Hermann said.</p>
      
      <p>“You don’t?”</p>
      
      <p>“Not in the slightest.”</p>
      
      <p>“Remember when you sent me that enciphered message?” Newt said in a reminiscent voice. “Without any explanation? That was a risky move.”</p>
      
      <p>“Why? Because the government was reading my mail? Or because you might not be up to breaking it?”</p>
      
      <p>“It was just a bit of a <em>move, </em>that’s all,” Newt said, grinning.</p>
      
      <p>“You had written that you enjoyed my puzzles. It was simply...”</p>
      
      <p>“Yes, I know what I said!”</p>
      
      <p>Hermann’s cheeks were pink. “Yes, well. When you did decipher it, it was quite tame.”</p>
      
      <p>“I had to go upstairs and get a lesson from the coding bay.”</p>
      
      <p>“I appreciated your commitment to the question.”</p>
      
      <p>“Newt Geiszler: committed to the question til they commit me to the institution.”</p>
      
      <p>Hermann took a sip of his drink, eyes smiling.</p>
      
      <p>“Still, I prefer just doing the crossword together,” said Newt.</p>
      
      <p>Hermann set his glass down. “So do I. It is a great relief to no longer have to scan the Entertainment section of the newspaper to keep up with questions about the Beatles’ membership.”</p>
      
      <p>“Glad to help you purge that knowledge from your mind. It can live in mine forever. By the way, how many of them are there?”</p>
      
      <p>“How many what?”</p>
      
      <p>“Beatles.”</p>
      
      <p>Hermann thought about it. “Between 3 and 6.”</p>
      
      <p>Conversation wandered to linguistics. Twenty minutes later their waiter interrupted a heated discussion about the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis to tell them the restaurant was closing.</p>
      
      <p>“Your bandmate Laurie is a bad influence,” Hermann said as they got into the lift. Laurie, their drummer, was a linguistics professor by day. Once, she had given Newt an informal lesson on syntax trees; Newt’s subsequent attempt to share that knowledge with Hermann had led to such a blow-up that any mention of syntax trees was still banned in Hermann’s apartment.</p>
      
      <p>Newt took Hermann’s arm, closing his eyes as the elevator moved upwards. “Why don’t <em>you </em>show <em>me</em> color terminology that...”</p>
      
      <p>“Yes? That what?”</p>
      
      <p>“Speaking of Laurie,” Newt said, abruptly conversational. “Gig tomorrow.” His eyes were still closed.</p>
      
      <p>The elevator dinged. “That’s a shame,” Hermann said.</p>
      
      <p>“Right. Yeah,” said Newt. “Probably too dangerous.”</p>
      
      <p>“Definitely,” said Hermann, leading him out of the lift and back to their rooms.</p>
      
      <p align="center">*</p>
      
      <p>Hermann turned on the classical station and resumed working. The messages would only reveal themselves through each other: Hermann had to guess each word of one correctly before he could decipher the other. It was like doing a crossword puzzle without any hints.</p>
      
      <p>The A/C unit was climatizing aggressively, so Newt dragged the blanket off the bed and curled up under it on the couch. He was soon asleep. Hermann worked steadily, facing his muted reflection in the wide black glass, vague against the dim city lights. Bach played, Newton snored lightly, and he kept working.</p>
      
      <p>It was well past 2 AM by the time he finished, and Newt was fast asleep. The radio was still playing quietly. But at the slight sound of Hermann setting his pen down, Newt’s snoring cut off.</p>
      
      <p>“You got it?” he said blearily.</p>
      
      <p>He twisted so he could look up. Hermann was rereading what he had deciphered.</p>
      
      <p>“What is this, Gregorian monk music?” Newt mumbled. He stood, unsteady with sleep, and went to look over Hermann’s shoulder. The words were in German and did not resolve immediately to his eye, but he was duly impressed. He kissed Hermann on the temple. “You’re brilliant.”</p>
      
      <p>“Newton.”</p>
      
      <p>Something had emptied out of Hermann’s voice.</p>
      
      <p>“What?”</p>
      
      <p>“The source. In 1971.”</p>
      
      <p>“What? Who was it?”</p>
      
      <p>“The Abteilung picked him up after he woke up from a coma. He says he has the location of the transmitter, but he’ll only tell it to Robert Bowen. And they ask for special radio equipment for him—mono input headphones. Because he’s deaf in one ear.”</p>
      
      <p>Hermann looked up at Newt.</p>
      
      <p>“It’s Charles Rennie. He’s alive.”</p>
