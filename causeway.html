    <h1>Chapter 1: The Dacha Hostel</h1>
    <h2>DAY 1</h2>
    <p>APRIL, '51</p>
    <p>Riding the Causeway northeast was like reading a seismogram: steady, small waves, until—geological interruption. The Valènce Peninsula, 500 km from Revachol West. Here, where the highway met the ocean, elevation jumped and dropped, coast curved in and out. The interpelagic highway trailed erratically north along the Insulindic coast, winding along cliffs and slopes, swooping over deep river gorges, no longer following the cardinal rhythms of human mapmakers or roadbuilders. It was as if the road itself was trying to slow down its travelers—cargo lorries, INSURCOM military transport vehicles, and the occasional 'bus or MC—the closer they came to the edge of the ocean, the edge of the world. </p>
    <p>It was to this lonely coastal outpost that Kim Kitsuragi—not Lieutenant or Detective Kitsuragi, right now, just Kim, a state of self he did not prefer—was traveling—not by motor carriage, but by omnibus, a state of being he definitely disliked. And tasked with—burdened by—stewardship of a dog—a state of being he wished, above all else, not to be in. </p>
    <p>And there was, inexplicably, on this lonely, foggy stretch of road 50 km from the edge of the world, a traffic jam. </p>
    <p><span class="skill">L'EMERGENCE: At the edge of every isola, the Pale eats away like an ocean. The breakdown from matter to Pale is known as Porch Collapse. Within a radius of +/-50 km from this point, the tide of nothingness ebbs in and out, creating a corona of anomalies, irregularities, and space-time displacement. This twilight zone is known as <em>l'émergence</em>.</span></p>
    <p><span class="skill">Insulinde has only two known zones of <em>émergence </em>that are contiguous with land: In the Semenese Archipelago, and the Valènce Peninsula, the easternmost cordon in the Zone of Control, on a large but underpopulated island connected to Le Caillou by interpelagic bridge. Cargo traveling northeast out of Revachol to Graad departs by airship port on Valènce, the last stop on the Emergent Causeway. </span></p>
    <p>"Do you have any idea what's causing the delay?" Kim asked the 'bus driver. </p>
    <p>L'Omnibus Octopus ("OctoBus! We only stop for red lights!") was nearly empty and depressingly in need of a paint job or euthanasia. In front of their grimy windscreen, curving around the next slope of coastal road, Kim could see a line of red taillights. </p>
    <p>The camion behind them honked.</p>
    <p>The omnibus driver, an implacable middle-aged woman in an ill-fitting scarlet uniform, shrugged. </p>
    <p><em>Great. </em></p>
    <p>Kim's (and the dog's) destination was not the Port of Valènce, but the remote town of Ifrania, some 50 km south of the port.</p>
    <p class="skill">IFRANIA-DU-ROI: Founded in the Dolorian Century as a military retreat for the Army of the Suzerain posted at the Valènce Base. Cliffs, birds, dangerous tides. After Revacholian independence, abandoned. During the Antecentennial Revolution, the ICM used the retreat as a stronghold after they bombed out the Port of Valènce. Now, a small village sustained on the oyster trade. Most of the population today is Iilmaraan, Samaran, and Ubi.</p>
    <p class="skill">Ifrania is also home to one of the oldest—possibly, it's disputed—evidence of pretermodern human settlement on Insulinde, Les Six Soleils. It was once a popular stopping point for tourists wishing to hike the beautiful, but remote, Cliffs of Valènce.</p>
    <p class="skill">Valènce's third and final claim to fame is its mention the second verse of the '32 soft-rock hit, "Makin' Love in a Houseboat," which peaked at #5 in the Revacholian pop charts. That one is best left to the graveyard of time.</p>
    <p>Les Six Soleils was more a legend than an archaeological site. Some said it was a hoax to drum up tourism. If it was, it was a failure. But Kim's destination was the cliffs, not the putative historical site. </p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span>"Leave means leave, Lieutenant. You've been "on leave" for almost a month, and you haven't taken a break. Before I even consider letting you back to your post, you need to take that dog and get away from the city. <em>Far </em>away."</p>
    <p>He had his hiking boots, his wool long underwear, his water-repellent poncho, even his camera, plus a precious—and expensive—box of 6 ampoules. In a used bookstore in his neighborhood, he had dug up a moth-eaten <em>Guide Gris</em> to "The Natural Wonders of Le Caillou and Surrounding Archipelagos," printed sometime before the revolution, for Occidental tourists. </p>
    <p>The only thing he was missing was a positive attitude.</p>
    <p class="skill">GRONKY, RCM COUNSELOR-IN-TRAINING: "A positive attitude is the <em>most </em>important part of the healing process. There can be no healing without a <em>growth mindset.</em>"</p>
    <p>Kim returned to his seat. The dog gazed at him dolefully. He ignored it. By his accounting—which was generally very precise—the 'bus was less than an hour away from his destination. Outside, fog hung low over the pines. The trees on the eastern side of the road were twisted by the sea wind. He looked idly over the trunks for signs of Palestorms, which the guidebook had described in vague terms. He wondered whether those "signs" were real or just superstition. </p>
    <p>Slowly, the omnibus inched down the long slope, and then around a curve, revealing a sliver of ocean between the pines. As the road curved uphill again, Kim found himself watching the log truck in front of them. An irrational dread was creeping over him, like the fog permeating the trees outside. He stared at it fixedly, as though, if he focused his energy on the possibility of one of the logs coming loose and smashing into the omnibus, killing the driver and possibly himself, then that misfortune was warded against actually occurring. </p>
    <p>When the hill peaked and they began a descent, he relaxed. He heard shouting and a horn beeping ahead, and slid back to his window to look. It was hard to understand, at first, what he was seeing at the bottom of the hill. Approaching in the vanishing point formed by the long line of windows, he saw the back half of a lorry, oriented not in the usual horizontal manner, but pointing up towards the sky. The dog started whining. There were people standing outside, on the shoulder of the Causeway, pointing and talking and staring at the lorry. And then they finally got close enough for Kim to see what was wrong—it was a sinkhole, open in the middle of the highway, eating up most of the road, and the lorry. </p>
    <p>"Well I'll be damned," said the omnibus driver, up front. </p>
    <p>She turned on her radio, and tuned it to the truckers' talk frequency as they slowly passed by. The sound of the men talking outside mingled with the staticky sounds of men talking about the sinkhole over the airwaves. Kim and the other two passengers stared silently out the east windows. A driver in a high-vis vest had taken on the role of traffic cop, and was waving each side of traffic through in shifts. Finally, it was their turn, and the Scarlet Bus lumbered over the muddy embankment, past the traffic jam around the black bottomless hole, and onward to freedom. </p>
    <p>The last slope disappeared and the landscape flattened into a wide salt marsh. Kim followed along on his fold-out map, tracing the route from the marsh to bay. The bay was cradled by the tiny peninsula of Ifrania—his destination. To the east, on the exterior—raging seas. To the west, inside the embrace of the bay—oysters.</p>
    <p>The Omnibus Octopus ("OctoBus! We'll get you there yesterday!") coasted across a long bridge, over the salt marsh, and with a great creaking, began to brake. </p>
    <p>The dirt road peeling off to the right was called DIKE RD. </p>
    <p class="skill">DIKE RD SIGN:</p>
    <p class="skill">IFRANIA-DU-ROI: 5 km. </p>
    <p class="skill">"ROYALISTS GO HOME"</p>
    <p>The omnibus driver, instead of turning right, pulled to a complete stop. "Ifrania-du-roi," she grunted.</p>
    <p>Kim stayed in his seat.</p>
    <p>"Doesn't the 'bus stop <em>in </em>Ifrania?" he said.</p>
    <p>A pause.</p>
    <p>"No. Stop's here."</p>
    <p>A massive surge of irritation and pain and loneliness and rejection—all things that someone could feel at this. And reasonably so. The bouncer in Kim's mind whose job was to let emotion in or out ruled that these were not to be admitted at this time. </p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="psy">BRAIN BOUNCER:</span> Don't think so, kids. </p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="fys">KIM'S EMOTIONS:</span> We demand retribution! We have rights! We demand entry! We demand blood!</p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="psy">BRAIN BOUNCER:</span> You're too drunk. Go pick a fight somewhere else. </p>
    <p>Physically containing the riot inside him was a learned skill, and so was disguising it—he exuded calm as he collected his rucksack from the rack above and clipped the leash on the dog, stood, and disembarked. (Never let them get a rise out of you. Never let them see that it bothers you. Never be what they want you to be.) Calmly, Kim said, "Thanks," and climbed off. The door closed behind him and with a great creak of strained suspension, the Octobus ("OctoBus! Go 8x faster!") heaved itself away. North, towards the port of Valènce, the last stop in Revachol. </p>
    <p>No passengers were permitted in the cargo airships between Valènce and Graad. His two busmates, if they weren't camionneurs heading for their next job, were almost certainly stowaways-to-be. </p>
    <p>Once the sound of the engine was gone, replaced with the silence of the wind and the distant rush of waves, Kim looked at the gravel shoulder and thought about kicking it. A 5 kilometer walk. A 5 kilometer walk, with his pack, and his injury, and this dog. He did not kick anything, but he imagined doing so.</p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="fys">KIM'S EMOTIONS:</span> BURN AND DESTROY OCTOBUS!!!!!!!!</p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="psy">BRAIN BOUNCER:</span> Keep it up, and I'll have to call the cops.</p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="fys">KIM'S EMOTIONS:</span> I AM THE LAW!!!</p>
    <p>He imagined kicking many things. To an outside observer, he would have simply appeared to be resting before starting to walk. </p>
    <p>Finally, he shouldered his pack (painfully) and began walking down the dirt road. The dog, who had waited impatiently on its leash, now started sniffing everything in sight excitedly, overwhelmed with the newness of the bay. Kim quickly lost patience for the tug-of-war and unclipped it, and it ran ahead, chasing a serpentine pattern over the pitted pavement. Skuas skimmed overhead, white reflections on the water. </p>
    <p>It was April. Damp and bright. The sky above the marsh was gray. The salt marsh water was gray. The trees were a darker shade of gray. The only color was the burgundy bark on some of the low-growing shrubs, and the sort of chlorinated blue at the tips of the evergreens. </p>
    <p>His shoulder injury quickly began to ache, dull and deep. There was no longer any danger that the wound would reopen, but the pack was straining the muscle tissue where it needed to regrow. Kim stopped, resting against the sea wall. He had lost sight of the dog. He entertained a brief fantasy wherein the dog ran away and found a new life with an oysterman. Then he whistled, and the dog rematerialized, collar jingling, soaked up to the neck in muddy marsh water. </p>
    <p>"That's going to smell disgusting," Kim commented. </p>
    <p>The dog made no reply. It was a dog.</p>
    <p>They walked for an hour. Late afternoon turned to dusk. The marsh turned to a bay. Low tide turned. Eventually the narrow strip of road revealed a house ("FREE FIREWOOD"), then two ("FIREWOOD: 0.5R"), then even another unpaved road branching off ("EGGS ⇨"). Kim stuck to the main road. According to his map, the hostel was on the hill in the center of town. </p>
    <p>In the gathering dusk, the road passed a wrecked fishing boat, half-sunk and rusted, resting in the bay. Mounds of oyster shells bordered the road. Shards of shell littered the dirt and the gravel like shrapnel. He passed a long, low building, a weather-worn warehouse; then, a small cemetery in a dip in the grass. On the other side of the road, there was a round, whitewashed turret. A guard tower. Its side was covered in graffito, and the wooden entry arm had been broken long ago, but here it was—the shell of the opulent military retreat. </p>
    <p class="skill">	IFRANIA DU ROI </p>

    <p class="skill">Pop: 501. </p>
    <p class="skill">[Crude drawing]</p>
    <p>In a folding chair next to the crumbling turret, an old Iilmaraan man sat with a fishing rod—the first person Kim had seen in Ifrania. Kim counted a total of four fingers on his hands. There was a bucket next to his chair too, but he wasn't fishing; he was just staring out at the bay. </p>

    <p>The town of Ifrania was an mix of the old, stately, whitewashed buildings, half of them abandoned, interspersed with more recent wood residences, sprung up like lichen around the rotting stone. There were fishing boats on blocks in front of houses, getting refitted for the spring. There were paddocks with horses waiting impatiently for dinner. People smoked on their little porches or in their little yards. Two strange dogs trotted up to them, one old and fat and one small and nervous, and Kim shooed them off. But they were curious about the newcomers, and followed him and his own canine up the slope to the hostel.</p>
    <p class="skill">THE DACHA HOSTEL:</p>
    <p class="skill"><x>NO</x> <u>VACANCY</u></p>
    <p class="skill">GUIDE GRIS, "THE NATURAL WONDERS OF LE CAILLOU AND SURROUNDING ARCHIPELAGOS," FOURTH EDITION: <em>In a rustic seaside setting, the Dacha Hostel is an ornate gem. Housed in the refurbished former retreat of the Royal Army of the Suzerain, it boasts antique mosaic floors, spacious rooms, and a bay view. In the summer season, it is host to beachcombers and hikers. In the winter season, it houses local oystermen and fishermen at discounted rates. Despite its charming architecture, travelers are urged to avoid the Dacha Hostel in the off-season, when the rougher clientele will make for a far less enjoyable visit. </em></p>
    <p>It was nearly dark by the time Kim arrived, and the once grand white walls of the colonial military retreat were a gray silhouette against the blue dusk. This building had been, once, the main event; the grandeur was gone now, all salt-stained walls and soot-streaked windows. On a balcony above the entrance, a smoker in a blazer leaned on a wrought iron railing. At the sound of the three jingling dog collars, he looked down at the newcomers and their welcoming committee. </p>
    <p>Kim entered the lobby of the Dacha Hostel—his home for the next week. For some reason, it was decorated with a tropical theme. There were large, leafy potted plants around the mosaic floor, and more than one golden pineapple. The floor mosaic looked to have been some nostalgic Mondiale motif. There was a definite odor of shellfish wafting from the cafeteria area, down a flight of stairs to the right. The air of luxury described by the guidebook was gone; it was clearly fallen on hard times, and what guests were loitering around the lobby and cafeteria entrance were clearly out-of-work fishermen. </p>
    <p>"No dogs in the rooms, I'm afraid," the Iilmaraan woman behind the desk told him. She wore her hair in short, thick cornrow braids, and she seemed quite over it. All of it. Her nametag said <em>Claudine Adedayo</em>, but she had not introduced herself. A warm hostess atmosphere did not seem to be her priority. </p>
    <p>"Oh," said Kim, looking down at the dog. It was sitting politely next to him, in front of the desk. It looked up at him, as if to say, 'See? I can sit politely.' </p>
    <p><em>Yes. I see. And how long can you actually continue to do so?</em></p>
    <p>"Is there a stable on the grounds?" Kim inquired.</p>
    <p>"Yes, there's one out the back," the Dacha manager said, jerking her head. "Shall we put him there for the night?"</p>
    <p>"The week," Kim said. The dog was female, but he saw no point in correcting her. </p>
    <p>"He won't run off?"</p>
    <p>"No," said Kim. "Unfortunately."</p>
    <p>"Henri!" the woman shouted, unexpectedly. </p>
    <p>The dog sprang to its feet, sensing conflict.</p>
    <p>A cloud of hair rose from a nearby armchair, followed by a head and torso.</p>
    <p>"What?" the cloud mumbled.</p>
    <p>"Our guest needs your assistance." </p>
    <p>"<em>You </em>need my assistance," the cloud grumbled, quiet enough for his mother not to hear. He emerged from behind the armchair. Henri was a gangly Black youth, probably 14 or 15, holding a comic book. His jaw and mouth were orbited by silver orthodontic jawgear. </p>
    <p>"Take the nice man's dog out back, to the stable, please, Henri," the hostel manager said. Wordlessly, Kim handed the leash to the teenager. </p>
    <p>"Then come back and bring his bag to his room," the hostel manager added, to her son's retreating back. She started tapping a complicated sequence of sums on her calculatrice. </p>
    <p>"That will not be necessary," Kim said, nudging his bag where it stood between his feet. </p>
    <p>"You are here to hike, are you not?" she said, still tapping. </p>
    <p>"Yes," said Kim after a weird hesitation.</p>
    <p>"Then you should not strain your shoulder any more than you already have."</p>
    <p>He frowned slightly at her. <em>Observant</em>. There was no bandage or sling anymore—at this point, it was only an internal injury. </p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> An eye worthy of a detective. </p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="int">DATA COLLECTOR:</span> What's <em>her </em>history? </p>
    <p>"May I borrow your luggage trolley?" Kim asked patiently, unwilling to yield ground but wishing to acknowledge her attentiveness. </p>
    <p>"Fine, then," the manager said, completing her calculation with a particularly vicious <em>clack</em>. Keys jingled and then dropped into Kim's palm. "Room 17. Ground floor. It's yours for the week. If you want to renew, find me. If I am not here, find Henri."</p>
    <p>"Thank you. Is there a map of the bay that I can peruse?"</p>
    <p>"In the cafe," she said, pointing. "On the wall. If you want a portable trail map for yourself, you'll have to go down to the <span title="Town hall"><em>Hôtel de Ville</em></span>." </p>
    <p>He unpacked in his room, ate in the cafeteria, examined the map, and smoked in his little bedroom with the window cracked. Cold, humid air wrapped around his bare arms. Antique lace curtains fluttered around his ears. The smoke from his cigarette raced out into the night to join the mist and the rain and the salty air. </p>
    <p>To the east, the ocean churned. Further east, the Pale. To the west, the bay was quiet. Further west, the Causeway. The long, thin thread connecting him to home.</p>
    <p>When Kim slept, he had the street racing nightmare again. </p>

    <h2>DAY 2</h2>
    <p class="skill"><span class="int">VRAIMENT VACHOLIERE:</span> The guidebook won't tell you this part, because it happened long after it was published. In the Antecentennial Revolution, the communards took the Valènce Base from the royalists. Once the commune was established, the ICM fortified the base, preparing for a potential invasion from Graad. The communards set up an auxiliary base in Ifrania, in the abandoned military retreat. Ifrania had storage, a bunker, plenty of housing, and a marina for launching small craft. As a militia base, it was perfectly suited. It was tidy, welcoming, and well-stocked for the 8 short years of the Commune of Revachol. </p>
    <p class="skill">The strategy was sound, but the fortifications woefully insufficient; the Valènce Base was a landing site when the Coalition Army attacked, and it was captured within two days. </p>
    <p class="skill">Many soldiers of the Black and White Army fled the base after the attack. In the confusing months that followed, as INSURCOM crawled over its new territory, searching for traitors, many militiamen trickled back to Ifrania, where they hid in the supply bunkers. The townsfolk hid them. It became the last communard holdout on the peninsula, one of the last in the ZoC. When the Coalition Army finally descended on it, in '10, the militiamen destroyed the road that branched off the causeway. The fishermen blocked the harbor. In the end, they came by aerostatic. All the militiamen left in Ifrania were executed. Their bodies were burned and their ashes were dumped into the Insulindic. All loyal communist citizens who had harbored them were arrested. The town was actively occupied by INSURCOM until '15. </p>
    <p>On his first day of hiking, Kim overextended himself. He embarked on a challenging cliff loop on the other side of the bay; starting on the edge of town, he walked 5 km back inland, then climbed steeply for 2 km, and then walked on the top of the cliffs for several kilometers—more tiring than it sounded—followed by a steep, challenging descent, and a long, long walk back via beach, on loose sand. It was almost 20 km in all, and by the time he got back to Ifrania, he was exhausted. The dog seemed to have enjoyed it, which Kim told himself he was not allowed to resent. (<em>It's a dog.</em>) It had found no end of foul-smelling things to investigate and then roll in. Immediately upon return to the Dacha Hostel, Kim escorted the dog back to the stable, then found Henri and asked him to feed it. </p>
    <p>"Sure, whatever," Henri said, not looking up from his BD. Kim, holding his shoulder with his other hand (it was aching fiercely), sighed minutely. Someone else's responsibility, now. If only he trusted the sullen teen to actually take care of it. </p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="int">INTERPERSONAL ACUITY:</span> I don't. </p>
    <p class="skill">RCM MEDICAL TRAINING COURSE: You need a bag of ice. And anti-inflammatory medication.</p>
    <p>He decided to ask in the cafeteria, not wishing to entrust more medical information or responsibility to the Dacha manager. A friendly, seemingly stoned cook in an apron gladly gave him a bag of ice. Kim retreated with his meal (fish) to the seating area near the bar, where the chairs were more comfortable. He burrowed into an armchair, bundled the ice pack into a handkerchief, and rested it on his shoulder with a sigh of relief. The hike had left him hungry, but too exhausted to eat. His eyes drifted shut. </p>
    <p>Something woke him from dozing—a frisson of his senses, an instinct that someone was coming to wake him up. Someone familiar. </p>
    <p>When he fought his way back up to consciousness, reality cut across him more harshly than usual. No, his partner wasn't here. </p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> Not this time.</p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> But...</p>
    <p>But... there is someone. At the center of the room, and somehow at the center of its attention, a man stands at a table—outrageously dressed, outrageously out of place—slowly scanning around as if searching for someone. He's a long-legged, broad-shouldered bear in an ugly, ill-fitting shirt, unbuttoned with collar open, presumably to display his chest hair, or maybe to encourage a general atmosphere of disco wherever he goes. It's not actually a disco shirt, but the effort is there. The bear has a hangdog look in his eyes, long hair down to his shoulders, and outrageous mutton chops on his face. His pants are, despite the locale (remote Insulindic fishing village) and the year ('51), flare-cut. Though Kim has to respect the spirit of the effort—it's commendable, presenting yourself with no regard for trend, for how others want you to be, or for restrictive hetero-sexual ideas of "propriety"—the overall effect is one of faded glory, and rather sad. </p>
    <p>Kim feels like he knows a million things about this man, before even learning his name. </p>
    <p>What's immediately obvious is that this man is someone who attracts a lot of attention, and people like that are to be avoided at all costs. Especially while Kim is trying to "relax." </p>
    <p>But the attention he's attracting is also Kim's. </p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="int">DATA COLLECTOR:</span> There's just so much to take in. It's a feast of information. You could spin his entire life story without ever asking him a single question.</p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="psy">VOLTA DO MAR:</span> People like this are a different species from us. </p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="psy">BRAIN BOUNCER:</span> No, they aren't. You put up a story for the world, just like he does. It's just a different story. With fewer chapters available to the public.</p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="psy">VOLTA DO MAR:</span> Yeah, no. This? It isn't a story. This is the truth. People like this live one life, on one wavelength, as one persona. The person who they are when they talk to others—that's who they are in their own head, too. They might as well be aliens from the moon for all we have in common. </p>
    <p>The bear is standing with his hand on his chair, at a little high-top table, which he's sharing with another man (a date?). The other man is also dressed incongruously for the setting, but not for the decade—he wears a brown, professorial suit, with a sweater underneath. Kim can't really make out his face from this distance. That's when Kim notices the jacket, hanging off the back of the bear's chair. It's a green blazer, with white, rectangular patches on the shoulders and back.</p>
    <p>RCM patches.</p>
    <p>Kim lets the ice pack fall off his shoulder and slide in between his leg and the cushion. The stranger has no way of knowing, of course, that Kim is also an officer of the RCM, but this instinct is absolute: show no weakness.</p>
    <p>M. Vacation<em> Flic </em>(he isn't on duty or local, the RCM regiments of Revachol's outer regions have different insignia) is not actually looking <em>at</em> Kim, but he is scanning the bar area as if looking <em>for</em> someone. </p>
    <p>He finds his mark—a woman sitting alone, reading. He approaches her table. The woman looks up from her book, visibly skeeved by Vacation Cop, or, as he probably appears to her, Aging Disco Asshole. The RCM patches have violently reoriented Kim's perception of this man, knocking over the dominoes of his initial impressions into a cascade of assumptions: Faded glory cop, heavy drinker, probably a chauvinist, probably hasn't been useful to his precinct in over a decade, probably here to—what? Here, of all places? Why Ifrania? Why the Valènce Peninsula? </p>

    <p>"No... thank you," the woman is saying. It sounds like whatever he said was weird—not what she expected, in a good way, but also not what she expected, in a bad way. </p>
    <p>This unique and unexpected situation, 500 km from home, presents Lieutenant Kitsuragi with a fight-or-flight dilemma. Flee, and escape the attention of this attention-siren. Escape to the safety of your room, unnoticed, just the way you always are, just the way you prefer to be. Or stay, and—and what? The dilemma reveals an underlying problem, a previously undetected structural flaw. Lieutenant Kitsuragi, of Revachol West, knows exactly who he is. Kim, off-duty at home, at a club, at the motor pool, knows who he is, too. But Kim Kitsuragi, lone traveler, far from home—who is he? He isn't a cop, and he doesn't have a partner, and he isn't a date, and he isn't a torque dork, and he has a dog. </p>

    <p>Kim decides to stay.</p>
    <p>Sober Cop gives the woman a little two-finger salute and moves on. When he turns his attention towards Kim, Kim is ready. He's sitting up straight, ankle over knee, dinner plate balanced on his thigh, ice bag concealed behind his ass. </p>
    <p>"Hello there, sir," Sober Cop says, positioning himself offensively close to Kim's armchair. Kim looks up over the rim of his glasses, without tilting his head back. The stranger proceeds: "You look like a man in need of some company tonight."</p>
    <p>Kim's eyebrows climb.</p>
    <p>"I mean, social company," the stranger amends, though not as fast as he should. "My friend over there and I are looking for a third. To play cards."</p>
    <p>Kim finally speaks: "Was this the opening you used with that young woman over there?"</p>
    <p>Sober Cop thinks about that. "Oh. I can see how that might have sounded slightly suggestive, now that I think about it."</p>
    <p><em>Slightly</em>. "And you're certain you're talking about a game of cards?" </p>
    <p>"You want to play?" the man says, face lighting up with gratification. </p>
    <p>"I don't think I said that."</p>
    <p>Disco Flic frowns at him with his mouth slightly open, stymied. He doesn't seem stupid, but he also doesn't seem to understand how conversations are conducted. </p>
    <p>"We could make it worth your while," he finally says, raising his eyebrows suggestively.</p>
    <p>Kim's turn to frown. </p>
    <p><em>What?</em></p>
    <p>"You're <em>absolutely </em>certain that you're talking about a game of cards?" No longer an ambiguously flirty rebuff. A genuine question. </p>

    <p>Disco Cop's cheeks turn bright red. "No! I was talking about putting money on the game! Placing bets!" </p>
    <p>Kim's eyes narrow. He is not embarrassed, but Bear Cop clearly is, raising questions about his awareness of—or perhaps comfort with—his own sexuality. </p>
    <p>Kim nods towards his plate of food. "I'm eating. If you haven't found another player by the time I'm finished, I'll join you." </p>
    <p>Bear Cop smiles. "Great." He snaps with both hands and gives Kim finger guns. It's so unexpected, like everything else about this person, that Kim almost smiles. </p>

    <p>Kim eats his dinner (too salty) and<em> le flic ours</em> completes his circuit of the Dacha bar (no takers), and returns to his friend at the table. After a few minutes, he turns in his chair, looking for Kim. Kim can't see his expression from here, but like a hard-of-hearing lip-reader, he has a certification in body language. </p>
    <p class="skill">INTERPERSONAL ACUITY (challenging): Try to understand Bear Cop from a distance.  </p>

    <p>One arm over the back of the chair, other hand on the knee, head tilted. </p>
    <p class="skill">SUCCESS: <em>"You coming?"</em></p>
    <p>Kim joins <em>le flic ours </em>and <em>ami</em> at the table, where the introductions are made. The bear's name is Harrier (Harry), his friend's name is Armin, Kim's name is Kim, and the name of the game is Pétillé. They do put money on the game. </p>
    <p>The deck of 64 is divided evenly among them, and the game begins. Kim has played a lot of Pétillé in his day, in various back rooms of Precinct 57 and Processing, which Harry the Bear does not know, because he doesn't know Kim's a cop too, and which Armin the Suit doesn't know either, because he hasn't asked. He seems stuck-up, to Kim; harder to read, and less interesting when read, than his companion. He has a pinched mouth with a permanent scowl at the corners. He isn't old, probably in his mid-40s, but there are already lines there that never smooth out. He doesn't make much small talk. Neither does Kim. Harrier le flic does the talking for all three of them. </p>
    <p>Kim's initial hand is strong, making him start out confidently, but his reserve deck reveals itself to be weak, and Harry wins the first game, which delights Harry and seems to annoy Armin. Kim magnanimously refrains from feeling irritated at this loss, because Harry seems to need the money (20 réal), and also because he (Kim) is better than Armin. Armin just doesn't know it yet. </p>
    <p>In the course of the second game, Kim makes a stupid miscalculation with his suzerain, and learns that Armin is from Graad. Armin ends up winning the second game, which does irritate Kim, especially since it was his own fault for losing his best hand. Harrier le flic leaves to "Get a drink," and Kim silently predicts what kind of drink it will be. The man has the ragged, high-octane energy of a recently dry drunk, so it'll be something with a gut-corroding sugar content. While he's gone, Armin makes no attempt at friendliness, instead shuffling the cards silently, over and over. </p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="mot">DEXTERITY:</span> He's stacking the deck. Watch out. Make sure he doesn't slip any cards up his sleeve.</p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="int">INTERPERSONAL ACUITY:</span> He doesn't strike me as that kind of guy.</p>
    <p class="skill">SPEED DEMON N° 1111: He'd better not be. We need to win this game, and the one after it. Those last two rounds were just a warm-up. This guy is <em>not</em> leaving this table with any of your money. </p>
    <p>Harry returns with his soda, spinning his chair around and straddling it backwards, chin resting on the top rail. PEACHPIT COLA™, Mondial Orange-Mint Marmalade. Kim's eyebrows knit in distress at this mélange of flavors. Harry cracks it open, but with notably less verve than before, and then doesn't drink. </p>
    <p>Armin continues shuffling.</p>
    <p>Kim studies him, with his big arms around the back of the chair, embracing his RCM-emblazoned blazer. His look is distant and morose. Sometime during the trip to the cafe counter, his mood dropped. Kim guesses it has nothing to do with the card game or the soda. </p>
    <p>"Peachpit Cola?" Kim says, making conversation as Armin starts dealing. </p>
    <p>"I can't drink liquor anymore because of my liver," Disco Cop says, with disarming frankness. "If I have another drink, I could die." </p>
    <p>"Oh," says Kim. </p>
    <p>Not much else to say to that. </p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="fys">VICE:</span> Sugar takes the edge off the craving. </p>
    <p>"You're an officer of the RCM?" Kim says, after a pause. </p>
    <p>Harry returns from whatever thought was occupying him— "Me?" </p>
    <p>"Yes. You." Kim nods at the blazer. </p>
    <p> "Oh," says Harry. "Yeah, I'm a officer. A detective." </p>
    <p><em>Me too, </em>Kim does not say. A thought, or really, an impression has been forming itself in the back of his mind. It now rolls fully into the light. </p>
    <h3>Thought Gained: Mysterious Stranger</h3>
    <p class="skill"><em>There's something familiar about this man. Have they met before? It's not impossible. You have a good memory for things like this. And it has an impression of this man from somewhere in the past. </em></p>
    <p class="skill"><em>Where have you met before?</em></p>
    <p class="skill"><em>But he doesn't recognize you. You could say something about it, and then maybe Harrier's memory would be jogged, and he'd solve the mystery for you. But you won't do that. You'll try to remember it yourself, first, won't you?</em></p>
    <p class="choice"><em>1. I can figure this out. I have an excellent memory. (Proceed)</em></p>
    <p class="choice"><strong>➤<em> 2. This is going to bother me, but as long as he doesn't remember me, it isn't actually important. [Discard thought]</strong></em></p>
    <p>Kim could admit their possible acquaintance—the RCM—to this man, but that would mean placing himself in the position of the person with the poorer memory. It would also mean surrendering information, and potentially surrendering ground—what if it unlocks more information about himself in the other man's mind, information Kim is not privy to? </p>
    <p class="skill">ESPRIT (MALIN) DE CORPS: Judgements made at any moment in your <em>long</em> career as a junior officer. Judgements that will <em>never</em> be forgotten.</p>
    <p>Kim refuses to begin their acquaintance on anything other than his own terms. </p>
    <p>Harrier picks at the shoulder seam and says nothing further.</p>
    <p>"How long have you been a detective?" Kim asks.</p>
    <p>He shrugs. "I don't really know." </p>
    <p>Kim frowns at that. "How can you not know?" </p>
    <p>Harrier le Disco Flic shrugs again. </p>
    <p>"...It's a long story." </p>
    <p>"Aces up," Armin says, in his nasally voice. </p>
    <p>Kim takes up his hand reluctantly. How much drinking <em>has </em>this guy been doing? </p>
    <p>It's a good starting hand for Pétillé. But to his vexation, Armin the Suit's seems to be better. He blocks Kim at every turn. Harrier is eliminated faster than usual, to which he sighs—"I'm out, fellas"—and he sits there watching as Kim and Armin go head to head, nursing his Peachpit Cola. </p>
    <p>In the haze of the competition, Kim has the impression that this man dreads being alone, and would sit and watch Kim and Armin painting a wall white if it would pass the time. But 90% of his faculties of concentration are focused on the game. 5% develops that thought about Mr. Disco Cop, and 5% maintains an attitude of disinterest. A bored expression, relaxed body language, a casually tapping foot. He feels Harry watching his hands. </p>
    <p>"Out," Kim finally admits, with very non-gritted teeth. He drops his last card into the middle of the table.</p>
    <p>Armin huffs a satisfied sigh, smiling smugly. Kim's toes curl up inside his boots. <em>Immense</em> dislike floods him. Intense desire for revenge overwhelms him. Carefully broadcasting no resentment whatsoever, he hands over his 20 réal. Armin thanks him, pocketing it. Harry watches the exchange. </p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> <em>He</em> can tell how pissed off you are. </p>
    <p>"It's been an interesting night, gentlemen, but I have to get to sleep," Kim says, standing up. His back and shoulder ache from the long day. "Enjoy your evening. And your trip." </p>
    <p>Harry gives a little two-finger salute. "Pleasure." Armin acknowledges him with a nod. Kim goes outside to smoke, and when he comes back in, he sees Harry the Disco Cop at the counter, paying for his room with the 20 réal he won at cards. Kim goes to bed resolving never to socialize in the hostel bar ever again. </p>

    <p class="skill"><em>> MUST-SEE: OSSETTE TRAIL</em></p>
    <p class="skill"><em>> Explorers with plenty of time may consider venturing to Ossette. This remote outpost offers grand adventures on the wild and scenic coast, as well as a MISCO World Heritage Site, Les Six Soleils. Les Six Soleils is located on a tidal island at the tip of the cape, and can be accessed by road, or, for adventurous hikers, by the beach cliff route likely taken by its creators, over 1,000 years ago. The tidal island is cut off at high tide by the <strong>Ossette Gorge</strong>. The experiential highlight of this area is the 12 km triangular <strong>Ossette Trail, </strong>which starts at the drive-in campground 2 km north of <strong>Ifrania-du-roi</strong> (see p. 40). </em></p>
    <p class="skill"><em>The first leg of the Ossette Trail angles east-northeast along the bay, and for most of its 1.5 km length, it is rustic boardwalk. (Hikers beware: These boardwalk planks can be slippery when wet, especially in the rainiest region of Insulinde! Trekking poles and hiking shoes are strongly recommended.) </em></p>
    <p class="skill"><em>At 1.5 km, before the <strong>Ossette Gorge</strong>, the trail splits. The <strong>Sentier des Soleils</strong> goes<x> </x>north <x>via bridge</x>* to the île des Soleils, while the Ossette Loop continues down the cliffs, to the Insulindic beaches. The stone stairs are extremely steep and slippery, and accessible <u>only</u> at low tide. </em>*NOTE: <u>BROKEN</u></p>
    <p class="skill"><em>The staircase will emerge at the eastern mouth of the Ossette River Gorge. Wildlife enthusiasts can examine fascinating tide pools here! But beware! The tide comes in quickly! </em></p>
    <p class="skill"><em>Follow the gorge west, towards the Insulindic. The stone staircase up to the tidal island is similarly steep. (For the Sentier des Soleils, see p. 45.) To continue on the Ossette Trail, follow the beach west and then turn south. From the cobblestone strand, it is 7 km to <strong>Cormorant Point</strong>. Finish at the Ossette Campground (<x>seasonal: June - October</x>). Boardwalks cover much of the trail heading northwest, back to the trailhead. *</em>CAMPGROUND CLOSED</p>
    <p>On the second day of so-called "vacation," Kim rose early and hitchhiked to his destination, a trailhead just north of the village—not far, but not worth the extra 5 km to-and-from. He had learned his lesson the day before. The MC was old and wheezy, carrying three men to their job packing oysters at a plant an hour further up the Emergent Causeway. The Republic Oysters packing and shipping facility was close to the port, as the chattiest of the three workers told him through the open back window (Kim and the dog rode in the flatbed)—that way the oysters were at their freshest before shipment through the Pale. When they got to the other side, they could still legally be called freshly-packed—packed that very day, in a way, since time passed in the Pale had no meaning. The downside was that sometimes, Palestorms rolled inland, shutting the factory down for days at a time. </p>
    <p>"Or, they say it's days. If we're stuck in there when a storm starts—we got no idea!" </p>
    <p>The worker laughed at this. His companions seemed unamused. Kim smiled vaguely, nodding. By his reckoning, they had passed into l'émergence a few minutes before.</p>
    <p>It was another gray, rainy day. Only a drizzle, as Kim set out on the boardwalk, but it soon started raining harder. Thunder rumbled in the distance, over the sea, and Kim wondered about those Palestorms. There had been nothing on the radio about it this morning, but entroponetic instruments were still fairly unreliable, and it was said that the entroponologists were wrong more than 50% of the time. </p>
    <p>Well, there was nothing for it. If a Palestorm did roll in, he'd be trapped in the same moment for a few days, or sent stumbling back a few hours in time, or perhaps spatially rearranged—head replaced with arm, arm replaced with tree branch. Nothing he could do about that, really. </p>
    <p>"I accept this," Kim said to the swamp trees.</p>
    <p>In reply, the rain water drizzled off the evergreen branches and fizzed on the water below. The dog's collar jingled, somewhere in the shrubs nearby. She barked, and a few birds went fluttering off.</p>
    <p>It was peaceful in the marsh, in an oppressive, silent sort of way. Kim thought about the card game the night before, the two strangers, one dull and one interesting, in a brightly colored toxoid-flèche frog kind of way. And familiar—why, <em>why</em> was he familiar? </p>
    <p>The brackish marsh populated with gray trees, some dead, some still in hibernation, in early April. Even the needles of the evergreens looked black, slick with water and unlit by sunlight. The boardwalk was treacherously slippery and 50% rotted, obviously unmaintained since his <em>Guide Gris </em>was published—since the Revolution, when the Revacholian tourism industry had been extinguished. Kim reflected on his being here, wondering if this was the vacation of a class traitor. A hiking trip was rather bourgeois. But it was also cost-efficient, since the 'bus tickets were footed by the RCM (compensatory funding for administrative leave), and the hostel was cheap. And it was good for the dog. </p>
    <p>Soon, the ground began to slope upward. They left swamp for a few meters of solid ground, and then the trail rose steeply into wooden steps, similarly unmaintained. Kim picked his way through the scrub, forgoing the rotting stairs. He started to hear the sound of waves and seagull cries echoing through the gorge, strangely dampened, like they were coming from inside a vast sewer. </p>
    <p>Finally, they reached the top of the cliff. The gorge opened before them, a dizzying 75-foot drop, steep and treacherous. Water swirled below, washing in and out of the gorge from both sides—west, into the bay, and east, into the open Insulindic Ocean. Kim looked towards it, as he had yet to see it in all its glory, but from here, it still remained a big gray blur. </p>
    <p>"Wow," he murmured. </p>
    <p>He thought about taking a photo, but he was hesitant to spend the ampoule.</p>
    <p>His guidebook told him there was a bridge, and Claudine, the hostel manager, told him it was broken. From here, he couldn't tell. The tide was still going out, meaning he couldn't go down into the gorge yet, so he tramped along the cliffside to investigate the bridge. A whistle brought the dog leaping over to him. </p>
    <p>"Don't go too far," Kim told it. "And leave the birds alone."</p>
    <p>The dog's pink tongue lolled from its grinning mouth. It was having a grand old time. </p>
    <p>The bridge was quite distressingly broken. The wood planks were black with rot, and the metal girders were pulling apart from either end, like ripping fibers. A seagull's scream echoed from across the gorge, sounding almost human. </p>
    <p>Kim deposited his little pack, and then walked out on one of the beams. Boot in front of boot. He stayed on the metal, stepping over slick wood. The drop below, with just one layer of rusted steel holding him up, made his stomach reel. He could hardly make out the bottom of the gorge. Below him, white gulls and gray skuas wheeled; below them, the water churned over sharp black rocks. The thrill woke him up. His heart thumped. The wind sang in his ears. </p>
    <p>After the excitement wore off, he sat on the broken bridge and read a book he had picked up from the Dacha Hostel's weird little left-behind library (a book much too embarrassing to own for himself), while the tide went out. It took about an hour. 10:50. Too early to eat lunch. When the water was low enough to enter the gorge, he and the dog descended the slick stone staircase (carefully), carved into the steep cliff. He took off his socks and shoes and waded in the low water, walking west out of the gorge on the bay side. He watched the oystermen at work for a little while, then turned around and made his way back west. </p>
    <p>Towards the Insulindic. At last.</p>
    <p>The high, narrow enclosure of the gorge reminded him of the alleys of Revachol, and he felt a pang of homesickness. It was so quiet here—only the wind and the birds, no traffic, no horns, no voices, no radios, no one. Just Kim and the dog.</p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> Where is that dog?</p>
    <p>Kim looked around, but saw no dog-like movement among the low rocks. He put his fingers in his mouth and whistled. <em>Jingle. </em>The dog was up ahead, behind a rock. </p>
    <p>"Hey," he said, not knowing why he'd gotten worried all the sudden. The dog looked up at him. Then it took off, towards the open ocean. </p>
    <p>Kim watched it go. There was a clump of birds circling a rock, landing and taking off, and the dog tore towards them, barking madly. The birds flew off the rock, mostly—one remained, a gray smudge on the black lump of stone. </p>
    <p>The dog kept on barking, barking, barking. It was about 20 m away now, and Kim could see that its tail was wagging, the way it did when it found something, the way it had been trained. As the smudge of rock resolved into a more definite shape, Kim saw that it didn't really look like the rest of the rocks in the gorge, sharp and black. This one was more round and flat, almost like mud. The bird, finally, reluctantly took off. But the dog went on barking at the rock. </p>
    <p>Kim, without really knowing why, started jogging, hugging his boots to his chest like a rugby ball. The dog barked, tail wagging, bounding towards the rock and then backing off again. </p>
    <p>The wet sand gave way beneath Kim's cold, bare feet as he slowed to a walk. The rock was mud-brown, flecked with sand, with an elbow sticking out towards Kim. It was a person. Dead, almost definitely. </p>
    <p>"Hello? Sir?" Kim spoke sharply, voice echoing off the rocks. "Sir, are you all right?" </p>
    <p>The dog barked and barked. </p>
    <p>Kim reached the figure, and circled it, dropping to a crouch. The face was pale, not yet unnaturally so, but there was a deep, dark gash in the side of the face. And Kim knew the face. It was Armin, from the hostel, wearing the same clothes as the night before. He was dead. </p>
    <p>And the tide was coming back in. </p>

<h2>DAY 3 - 11:30 A.M. </h2>
<p>Kim requisitioned his "travel journal" (so far used only for budget sums) for crime scene reporting. The dog was still barking—"Hey!" he said sharply. He pulled off a glove and whistled sharply. The dog sat immediately. Then it let out one more "woof!" of excitement. Duty never superseded emotion for this one. </p>
<p>One thing he and the dog did <em><em>not </em></em>have in common. </p>
<p>Vacation Kim was banished from the scene—the feeling left by his absence was something like relief. </p>

<p>He made eye contact with the dog. Its tail wagged. It couldn't help. But god, did it want to. </p>
<p>Kim pressed his fingertips into the bridge of his nose, then took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes. </p>

<p>Any exit wound?</p>
<p>The thought was somewhat sickening. He couldn't tell what had made this gash. It was something much thicker than a knife—like a spike, or a saw. What was long enough to make a hole like that, and could be wielded with enough force to pierce a skull?</p>
<p>Firmly, he pressed his plastex-gloved hand into the flesh around the gash in the face. It was hard in some places, and soft in others—as though rigor mortis was setting in selectively. </p>

<p>FLASH. CLICK.</p>
<p>The ink bloomed to life on the photoreactive paper. Kim carefully placed it on the sand, wedging a pebbles on each corner so the ink could set, undisturbed. </p>

<p class="skill"><span class="psy"><span class="psy">BRAIN BOUNCER:</span></span> Go away, Vacation Kim.</p>
<p>He paced slowly around the body, taking in the clothes—dirty, disturbed, almost unrecognizable as the clothing he'd worn in the hostel bar only 14 hours before—and the shoes. ...And what was that, on the soles?</p>
<p class="notebook"><em><em>VICTIM'S CLOTHES: Brown tweed suit, brown sweater, brown belt, brown brogues. Victim seen night before wearing same clothes by KK. </em></em></p>
<p>There was a smudge of something on the soles, something Kim couldn't quite make out—but it was not the same color as the sand below them. </p>
<p>He knelt in the sand and leaned in close, until the outsoles of the victim's shoes came into focus. Water soaked through to Kim's knees. He glanced down. A puddle, waiting under the sand to form. The ocean was creeping back in.</p>
<p>11:40 a.m.</p>
<p class="notebook"><em><em>Outsoles: Brown mud, beach sand. Left shoe only: Whitish substance, on waist and inner lip of heel. Traces of same substance in treads, mostly worn away. </em></em></p>
<p>Kim had nothing with which to swab, and nowhere to store a materials sample. He took off his glove and ran a bare finger through the substance inside the heel of Armin's shoe. He felt it between the pads of his fingers, trying to memorize its grit. Chalky, but slightly more substantial than powder—more like a fine dust. Oddly sticky. It began to clump together between his fingers. </p>
<p class="notebook"><em><em>Substance is fine and chalk-like; small amount clumps together when exposed to skin oils. Dry clay?</em></em> </p>
<p>He stood again and completed his slow circuit of the body, taking in the way the limbs splayed, the way the fabrics creased. </p>
<p class="notebook"><em><em>Water stains up to 3-5 cm. Clothing creases consistent w/ dragging by jacket?—not carried. </em></em></p>
<p>Kim would have to flip him over to verify that. A quiet sigh of water broke his concentration. The foamy edge of a wave brushed Armin's heel, nipping away half of the white dust. </p>
<p>No more delaying. He took out a handkerchief and covered his nose and mouth—more out of anxiety than fear of a smell—and kelt down to look at the back of his head. </p>
<p>There was an exit wound. Neat as a keyhole. It was next to the crown of Armin's hair. At the center of his head, one white star of scalp, and, beside it, a wound orbited like a misshapen moon. It was an eclipse of congealed blood over white scalp, with a halo of matted hair. Kim's heart thumped sadly—not faster, but harder—in sympathy. There was not much blood. Leaning at the right angle, he could see light coming in from the other side. A clean shot. The dim daylight illuminated the muddy texture of Armin's brain. </p>
<p class="notebook"><em><em>MAJOR WOUNDS (cont'd): face wound has exit wound in the back of skull, indicating a slightly elevated angle of entry, </em><u><em><u>OR POSSIBLY,</u></em></u><em> depressed angle of entry from behind. Unclear entry point. </em></em></p>
<p class="notebook"><em><em>No blood evidence on back of head or back of clothing. </em></em></p>
<p class="notebook"><em><em>Weapon unknown. </em></em></p>
<p>Kim stared into the sickening hole trying to think of any other notes to make, but looking at it made his mind go strangely blank. Finally, with regret, he took his Trigat again and loaded in another ampoule. Material evidence could be matched by sight and touch. A wound like this could not be. A wound like this could maybe not even be believed. </p>
<p>He clicked the little macro lens onto the camera. A flimsy accessory, good for barely more than a hand's distance, but better than nothing.</p>
<p><em><em>FLASH! CLICK. </em></em></p>
<p>A cold wave slid politely up under his knee, soaking one leg of his pants and the lower part of the body where it had barely begun to dry. Kim cursed (the dog barked) and stood up. <em><em>Not enough time...</em></em></p>
<p>The waves were coming in now. The initial scene examination was coming to an end, whether he liked it or not. </p>
<p>Kim squatted, looking over the body at the expanse of the still-dry sand. He looked in the direction of the beach, southeast, and then north, in the direction of the île des Soleils. The body could only have been dragged from two directions. With a quick glance at Armin he stood and began walking, slowly and as lightly as he could, up the beach, towards the tidal island of the Six Soleils. His footsteps barely disturbed the sand.</p>
<p>They were close to the bottom of the staircase. The dog followed eagerly, sniffing, and Kim knew it was collecting useful data, but he could never get that data out of its nose, so he snapped his fingers. "Sit," he said. He snapped again. "You. Sit." Reluctantly, the dog stopped sniffing. He snapped a third time, and it lay down on its stomach—ready to jump up again at the slightest provocation. </p>
<p>"You're disturbing the scene of the crime," he told it. <em><em>As usual. </em></em></p>

<p>An arm of water approached, but the ground sloped up here at the bottom of the stairs, and the water drew back, deterred. Kim knelt and examined the sand. </p>
<p class="notebook"><em><u><em><u>Sand</u></em></u><em>: (staircase) dry and loose. Does not hold pattern well. Bird prints, one dog footprint, one human shoeprint, appx 25cm (size 40?), pointed north (towards stairs). Pressure in heel, coming down hard from last step? (Walking backwards? Carrying heavy object?) Type of shoe, exact size, cannot be determined by this officer. </em></em></p>

<p>Kim reattached the macro lens and took a photo of the imprints. </p>
<p>He circled to the other side of the body, looking for more shoeprints going the opposite direction, south down the beach. He found none. </p>
<p>By now, the waves were lapping away around Armin's body, and Kim severely regretted wasting the time to look for nonexistent footprints. He rolled up the cuffs of his pants higher—the water was frigid, he felt the cold in every tiny bone in his feet—and waded back to Armin. Nature had disturbed the body, and he was running out of time. </p>
<p>Firmly, but as gently as he could, he pulled Armin by the shoulder, making him roll flat on his back. The water lapped up around his ears. Kim knelt in the cold water and placed his hand on Armin's chest for a few seconds. </p>

<p class="skill"><span class="psy"><span class="psy">BRAIN BOUNCER:</span></span> No.</p>
<p>Kim stood again, abruptly, legs trembling from the cold. A theory was forming in his head—a scenario. But the cold water was so painful he couldn't focus. </p>
<p class="notebook"><em><em>Creases in clothing may show that the body was dragged by </em></em></p>
<p>"Shit," Kim said out loud, pulling one foot out of the water. A bigger wave soaked up to the back of his calf and all the way up Armin's back, lifting the hems of his suit jacket. </p>
<p>"All right, let's go," he said, pocketing his notebook. He grabbed Armin by the lapels, and, bracing himself by bending his knees, began to drag him up the sand. The higher ground in the gorge would give him at least a couple of extra minutes. </p>
<p>They made it about 0.5 meters before Kim had to let go with his injured arm—panting, he tried to pull one-handed. Immediately, he heard a tearing sound, and stopped dead.</p>
<p class="notebook"><em><em>Creases in clothing may show that the body was dragged by assailant. Mud stains mid-thigh. Mud stains on stomach and upper chest. </em></em></p>
<p class="notebook"><em><em>Tears in armpit of jacket. Already present during exam, worsened by officer's attempt to move body. One button missing. Buttons are dark blue, 4 holes. </em></em></p>

<p class="notebook"><em><u><em><u>Why</u></em></u><em>? </em></em></p>
<p class="notebook"><em><u><em><u>From where</u></em></u><em>?</em></em></p>
<p>Huffing and puffing, Kim stopped there. He didn't want to tear the jacket any further, and he didn't think he could get much farther himself, not with his shoulder. </p>
<p>Water lapping at the soles of his feet and the back of his victim, he completed his examination.</p>
<p class="notebook"><em><em>Postmortem bruises and scrapes on chest and chin. </em></em></p>

<p class="notebook"><em><em>Back: No evidence noted, may have been washed away. </em></em></p>
<p class="notebook"><em><u><em><u>Conclusion</u></em></u><em>: Cause of death is most likely head/face wound. No other major injury discovered. No evidence of other head trauma or suffocation. Poisoning remains a possibility—cannot be proven or disproven by field exam. </em></em></p>
<p class="notebook"><em><em>Pockets: contents emptied by KK, bagged as evidence. </em></em></p>
<p>In his final act of communion with the dead, Kim took his lunch out of its brown paper bag, and used it to hold the contents of Armin's pockets, picked by Kim before the ocean could do it. </p>
<p class=notebook><em>- Dacha Hostel matchbook</em></br>
<em>- Notebook (empty, most pages torn out) </em></br>
<em>- Stubby pencil</em></br>

<p class=notebook><em><u>Missing</u></em>:</br>
<em>- Hostel room key</em> </br>
<em>- Other keys</em> </br>
<em>- Wallet / ID </em></br>
<em>- Money</em></p>
<p>By now, the waves had reached Armin's shoulders again. Kim's feet were numb but his knees were trembling from the cold. Gulls were shrieking overhead. The dog was jingling in the distance, investigating tidal pools. </p>
<p>Still standing in the icy water, Kim wrote, </p>
<p class="notebook"><em><em>Plausible scenario: Murder committed nearby, killer dragged body (TO or FROM?) stairs before noticing KK sitting up above. Abandoned body and fled scene. Expected ocean to do the rest. </em></em></p>
<p>And it would. </p>
<p>Kim stood, watching the first big waves submerge Armin's legs. A deep regret pulled on him, a regret that he could do more for this man. He couldn't even ensure a proper funeral. </p>
<p class="skill">ENCYCLOPEDIA: Revacholian funeral rites are unique to the Insulindian Isola. They are a close cousin of the Semenese <em><em>Sépulture Ulunbuir, </em></em>burial at sea. The body is cremated, and the ashes are placed in an unfired clay vessel. The clay vessel is cast out to sea in a funeral ceremony, where it will sink and dissolve over time, releasing the ashes of the deceased into the ocean. </p>
<p class="skill">In the Revacholian <em><em>sépulture en mer</em></em>, the body is cremated, and then the ashes are released into a moving body of water—ocean, river, waterfall, creek—while accompanied by a traditional song, sung by the family, friends, associates of the deceased. The tune and lyrics are learned early in life by most of the children of Revachol. </p>
<p>The melody of the sépulture began to play in Kim's mind, as if carried over the ocean from the Bay of Revachol. Armin was not from Revachol. He was from Graad. The funerary rites of Graad were unknown to Kim. </p>
<p>He stared out into the sea, past the sea stacks and the birds, to the gray horizon. He couldn't make it out, the darkness behind the swirling clouds, but he knew it was there; waiting for Armin, if the currents were right. </p>
<p>"Après la vie, la mort," he murmured. "Après la mort, la vie encore. Après le monde, le gris. Après le gris..."</p>
<p>Once the waves reached the hem of his pants, Kim retreated to higher ground—the stone staircase to the Sentier des Soleils. The waves had washed away the footprints he'd photographed. He dried his feet off with his fleece sweater and put on his wool socks, trying to rub some feeling back into his numb toes. There was still a spit of dry sand in the middle of the gorge, and if he hurried, he could cross it without getting his shoes wet. He stowed the brown paper evidence bag and the three (his heart ached—<em><em>three, half </em></em>of his ampoules, gone in less than an hour—) photos in the waterproof inner pocket of his backpack, took off his poncho, put the backpack on under the poncho, and then put his boots back on. </p>
<p>12:05 p.m. The water had half-covered Armin. He looked like an ocean rock again. </p>
<p>Sitting on the slick stone, icy moisture soaking through the seat of his pants, Kim felt his attention swing, suddenly, like a lodestone urging him north. Some instinct, the one that he would never admit to consciously but which guided him as a detective and kept him alive as a cop, made him turn away from the gorge, and look up the staircase. </p>

<p class="skill"><span class="int"><span class="int">DATA COLLECTOR:</span></span> The murderer?</p>
<p>Kim's hand drifted instinctively towards his holster. But he, of course, did not have it. His station-issued Armistice was in the Weapons Storage Room in Precinct 57, 500 km away. </p>
<p>Instead he touched the cargo pocket of his pants, where his camping knife rested, heavy and reassuring, against his thigh. </p>
<p>A large wave hit the rocks and a cloud of sea spray misted down over his face, fogging his glasses. Still Kim stared up the slick darkness of the staircase. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="int"><span class="int">LOGIC:</span></span><strong><strong> </strong></strong>(easy—success) If the perpetrator is up there, you have no backup. Don't go looking for someone dangerous when you have no backup, no weapon, no knowledge, and no authority. All you know about this person is they're a killer, and they have access to a weapon you've never seen before.</p>
<p>Quick as a flash, Kim stood and pulled out his knife. He didn't open it, but he didn't waste another second, not even on wiping his glasses. He leapt down the bottom steps on his half-numb feet, splashing into the low puddle of seawater, and whistled. </p>
<p>Immediately, the dog appeared from among the rocks, soaking wet. </p>
<p>"Let's go," he said, not loudly. It galloped over, as if to say, <em><em>I've been waiting for you to say that! </em></em></p>
<p>The ocean water had entered the gorge from both sides by this point, and east and west were moments from meeting in the middle. Kim mapped out a path he could take over the rocks without getting his boots wet. One last look at Armin—only his head and shoulder were still visible above the waves—and he took off. Rock under boot treads, arms out for balance, backpack bouncing off his spine, he leapt from stone to stone. The white waves flooded in below. </p>
<p>By the time he'd crossed the gorge and reached the eastern beach, the body was gone. </p>

    <h1 id="ch3">Chapter 3: REQUIN</h1>
    <p>The town of Ifrania-du-roi had no RCM presence. Kim learned this on his long walk home by asking at a few farms, houses, and encampments, and receiving only blank stares in return. A few people mentioned someone called "The Constable," but in a sort of last-ditch, 'you-may-as-well-try-it' tone that did not inspire confidence. On his walk, he also probed for information about 'phone and radio in Ifrania. He found out that the payphone at the Hotel de Ville was broken, and no one seemed to know whether the radio tower was relay or a broadcast station. </p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> You've done your duty as an officer outside of his jurisdiction. Now, your job is to hand this case off to someone local. </p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="int">DATA COLLECTOR:</span> But <em>who</em>?</p>
    <p>Upon finally returning home to the Dacha, wet and cold and sore all over, he was dismayed to discover that the hostel had no long-distance 'phone line. The Dacha manager told him that the nearest one was at the Port de Valènce, 50 km up the Causeway. </p>
    <p>Claudine told him that as far as she knew, the only law enforcement presence on the peninsula was the customs and border patrol at the Port—in other words, the large detachment of the occupying Coalition Army. </p>
    <p>He had had no way of contacting them from Ifrania unless he caught the omnibus to the Port. The next one left Ifrania in two days. </p>
    <p class="notebook"><em><x>• RCM Local Precinct</x></em></p>
    <p class="notebook"><em>• Long-distance phone: <x>at HDV? at Dacha?</x> at Port</em></p>

    <p class="notebook"><em>• 'bus (next is Thurs)</em></p>
    <p>"You could send a letter," Claudine suggested. She was troubled by Kim's story, and asked if he had any photos. He tried to divert the conversation from there, but she asked twice, so he was forced to show her the pictures of Armin's body. </p>
    <p>She looked at them for a long time. </p>
    <p>"Do you have any idea what kind of a weapon or object could cause a wound like that?" Kim asked, in his most unobtrusive voice. On the tile beside him, the dog fidgeted, muddy and wet. </p>
    <p>Finally, Claudine shook her head and handed the photos back. Her expression was unaffected. "No. I'm sorry. I thought I could help. But I have no idea. I've never seen anything like that." </p>
    <p>"Neither have I," Kim admitted, taking the photos. Claudine opened a drawer and produced a plastic zip-bag, which she slid wordlessly over the counter to him. </p>
    <p>"So you're an officer of the RCM," she said, prompting. </p>
    <p>Kim nodded as he slipped the photos into the bag. "Lieutenant, Precinct 57," he said. "Homicide detective. I work in Revachol West, in the Greater Industrial Harbor." </p>
    <p>She nodded, and asked no further questions. <em>That means she's been there, and knows where it is. </em></p>
    <p>"Well, I won't pretend that I know your jurisdiction, but the criminal element in this town is usually reprimanded by the Constable," she said. "You could take this to him."</p>
    <p>Kim noted that she had not said 'should'—she'd said 'could.' </p>
    <p>"I've heard of this Constable," Kim said, mirroring her skeptical tone. "What should I know about him?"</p>
    <p>"He won't want your help," she said frankly. "He doesn't solve this kind of thing." </p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="int">INTERPERSONAL ACUITY:</span> Stop making her your ally. You have already told her too much. Do not show her any more of your cards. Every person in this hostel is a suspect. </p>

    <p class="skill"><span class="int">INTERPERSONAL ACUITY:</span> Oh, shit.</p>
    <p>Kim had forgotten Harry the Bear completely. He was like a person from a dream—out of place in the daylit world. But he would have to be told that his friend was dead.</p>

    <p>The businesses and persons of note in Ifrania-du-roi communicated via a (venerable but sophisticated) system of intercoms left over by the Army of the Suzerain more than a century ago. Claudine showed Kim into her office, a neatly cluttered, dark-paneled closet of yellowing files and old calendars. She showed him how to operate the radio, and the list of frequencies and call signs, then left him alone. </p>
    <p>Kim put on the headset and laid out his notebook on the dark wood desk. It was mostly hidden behind and under file boxes, but it was heavy, finely carved—probably an antique from the Suzerainty. The dog snuffled at Claudine's trash barrel with great interest until Kim clucked his tongue at it, and it lay down. Flipping back to his field autopsy, he reviewed the information and prepared his statement. </p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> This is it. Passing the baton. Pass it as cleanly and neatly as befits your station and your reputation. </p>
    <p>On the list of call signs, he located <strong>Constable Bozeman</strong>—call sign <strong>REQUIN<em></strong>. </em></p>
    <p><em>Great, </em>Kim thought, <em>Unpopular</em> <em>local cop who styles himself as "the shark." </em></p>

    <p>REQUIN: "10-4, this is Requin. Dacha, what seems to be the problem? Over." </p>
    <p>In the privacy of the Dacha office, Kim rolled his eyes. </p>

    <p>DACHA: "Constable, please call back from a private location. Preferably a location where you can refer to a list of relay codes. I will stand by on this frequency. Over." </p>
    <p>A sullen silence came from the headset. After a few minutes, the light came on again.</p>
    <p>REQUIN: "Dacha, this is Requin. 10-12, please repeat your message."</p>
    <p>Ignoring the fact that he had used the wrong code, Kim proceeded:</p>

    <p>REQUIN: "10-4, message understood. Have you identified the body? Over."</p>
    <p>DACHA: "Yes. He was a guest at the Dacha, named Armin van Mauer. Native of Graad."</p>
    <p>(static)</p>
    <p>REQUIN: "10-4. Armin van Mauer... Continue, Dacha." </p>
    <p>DACHA: "I was able to make a preliminary examination of the body before the tide came in and pulled it out to sea. I regret that was all I was able to do, Constable. I took thorough notes and three photographs, all of which I can share with you. Requin, you have a pen and paper?"</p>
    <p>REQUIN: "10-4. Go ahead, Dacha."</p>
    <p>Kim read his notes out loud to the Constable. When he was done, Kim asked if he wanted the photos, to which he replied yes, please. Last, Kim confirmed that the Constable was, officially, taking over the case, and considering it a murder investigation. </p>
    <p>REQUIN: "10-4, affirmative. Proceeding with this as a murder investigation." </p>
    <p>Kim felt a sudden shiver of doubt.</p>
    <p>DACHA: "Requin, will this be your first murder investigation?" </p>
    <p>(static)</p>
    <p>REQUIN: "10-4, affirmative."</p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> Not your jurisdiction. Not your responsibility.</p>
    <p>REQUIN: "Already got a lead, Dacha. This is my town. Nothing goes on here that I don't know about. You did the right thing, reporting it to me. Over." </p>
    <p>DACHA: "I'll leave the photos at the Dacha's front desk for you to pick up. Over." </p>
    <p>REQUIN: "10-4, thank you, Detective. Over and out."  </p>
    <p>Kim ended the transmission and turned off the radio set. </p>
    <p>That was that, then. All that remained was to hand off his crime scene photos. </p>
    <p>He was waiting for the tension to unwind from his spine, the tension of an unsolved case, the tension of responsibility—but it stayed coiled tight around his thoracic vertebrae. </p>
    <p>The dog was still a soaking wet menace of mud and sand, so Kim took it out back to the stables to wash it. It led him confidently across the courtyard, where lichen was growing in between marble relief carvings on the tile walls and floor; an empty trellis covered half the courtyard, bare in early spring, letting the rain fall unobstructed into the courtyard. Water gurgled from the gutters and slid along a mossy trough, down a gravel slope and out of view. A few people smoked together around a wrought-iron cafe table, shivering in the late afternoon rain. </p>
    <p>The pump was at the far end of the barn. He found some towels in the tack-cleaning area and then spent a contentious half-hour trying to clean the dog. It was a large, long-haired creature, and though it wanted to be obedient and follow its training, it was cursed with odd anxieties and unpredictable sensitivities. Bathing was one of them. When it was finally over, both of their nerves were frayed. </p>
    <p>The dog yipped and sprinted down the long, dusty hall of the barn, making the horses stomp in annoyance. It skidded a u-turn and then pelted back towards Kim, trying to shake off the cold water. Kim sat back on his haunches, defeated and wetter than ever, and watched it run wild, rubbing his sore shoulder absently. </p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> You forgot to drop off the photos. And notify Harry the Bear. </p>
    <p>"Shit," he said aloud. </p>
    <p>Kim gathered his things and together they tramped back across the courtyard, to the lobby. The dog tried to greet the smokers (a new set) but Kim dragged it forward. </p>
    <p>It was late afternoon now, almost nearly dinner time, and the lobby was busier than before. It took several minutes for the manager to reappear at her desk. "Two things," Kim said. "First... I told the Constable I would leave these photos for him when he comes by." He slid them back to her, face-down.</p>
    <p>"Oh," she said. "He was already here. He didn't ask for him. I'll make sure he gets them—if he comes back."</p>
    <p>"He was already here?" Kim said. <em>Why didn't he talk to me?</em></p>
    <p>"Yes—he made an arrest," Claudine said. "You didn't hear the commotion?"</p>
    <p>"I was out back in the stables with this one," Kim said, indicating the telltale dog. It perked up, looking at him. <em>Me? Me?</em></p>
    <p>"I see," Claudine said. "Well, yes, it was quite the scene. He arrested another guest."</p>
    <p>"Another guest?"</p>
    <p>"Yes."</p>
    <p>"For this case?" Kim said, wishing to clarify. "This murder case?" </p>
    <p><em>How the hell did he already make an arrest? He hasn't even seen the body.</em></p>
    <p>"Yes," Claudine confirmed. "I'll make sure these photos get down to the HDV." She tapped the photos. "What was the second thing?"  </p>
    <p>"I wondered..." Kim hadn't even released the photos from under his fingertips when another commotion interrupted them. The sound of a jaunty horn and a motor carriage engine came from outside—a rare sound in this farm town—but not just any engine. A finely-tuned thrum, almost a purr. </p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="mot">TORQUE DORK:</span> That's the sound of an <em>antique, </em>darling<em>. </em>A Villiers Lebewesen. Probably Model H.</p>
    <p>The eyes of Kim, Claudine, and all the others milling around the lobby were drawn to the front doors. Through the plate glass windows, a forest green Villiers Lebewesen drew to a halt under the awning. It was a high-rider, the chassis riding several feet off the ground in a way which, though indicative of luxury, Kim had always found nauseating. </p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="mot">TORQUE DORK:</span> I was right. A Villiers Lebewesen Model H, '22 but kept in prime condition. Painted an unstylish but stately green. Rather <em>fetching</em>. </p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="fys">SPEED DEMON N° 1111</span>: <em>Rather </em>nothing. Rather <em>stuffy</em>. </p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="mot">TORQUE DORK:</span> But darling, that gold detailing...</p>
    <p>The sound of the engine and the horn had attracted the attention of the dog. It took off, breaking free from Kim's grip. "Hey!" </p>
    <p>On the other side of the wide-open doors, the passengers in the MC began to unload its cargo—a middle-aged Vespertine man in a fine wool coat, the same shade green as his MC, a well-groomed woman of similar age wearing a high collar and a silk scarf, and a little girl, probably 10 or 12, dressed almost identically to her mother. </p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="int">VRAIMENT VACHOLIERE:</span> What are <em>these</em> people doing <em>here</em>? </p>
    <p>The dog bounded up to them, barking excitedly. The father took off his driving gloves and shooed the dog away, but the daughter, clutching a book to her chest, peered demurely at the dog, as though she had never seen anything of the kind before. </p>
    <p>"Hey!" Kim whistled sharply. The dog ran back inside the lobby, then twirled around and ran back to the girl. She laughed at the dog, which encouraged it to do it again. </p>
    <p>Kim snapped his fingers and the dog finally sat in front of him. Its tail still wagged.</p>
    <p>"You've had enough excitement for today, I think," he said, collecting the leash. He pulled it aside in the lobby, out of the way of the wealthy Vespertines. They were already in apparent disagreement with Henri about something.</p>
    <p>"We don't have a garage," Henri repeated. "Ask my mum."  </p>
    <p>"Young sir, this was once the Ifrania-du-roi military retreat for the Army of the Suzerain," M. Vesper was intoning. "If it was built without a garage, I will eat my suitcase." </p>
    <p>"Is there a problem here, Monsieur?" the Claudine said, swooping like an eagle.</p>
    <p>While the Adedayos dealt with the new arrivals, Kim waited. It seemed to him that this morning had contained a day's worth of exertion in a single hour, and that this afternoon had consisted of a string of simple tasks that fate refused to let him complete. He was still soaked with rainwater. </p>
    <p>Another guest was hovering, shuffling his boots on the mosaic tile. Kim couldn't make out his features well, but he was clearly not a fisherman. The man was well-dressed, in a similar sort of professorial way to Armin. He wore glasses too, and a over-the-shoulder bag, and, incongruously, muddy brown boots. </p>
    <p>"Quite a scene," Kim said, and the professor looked over at him. </p>
    <p>The professor approached. "Sorry?" Within seeing distance, Kim thought he looked part Seraïse. His skin was brown, his face was rather handsome, and he looked to be around Kim's age. </p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="int">VRAIMENT VACHOLIERE:</span> Indeterminate accent. Local, or from the city?</p>
    <p>"Quite a scene," Kim repeated, "that car, the Vespertine family." </p>
    <p>It took a few more seconds for him to process Kim's words. "Oh! Yes, wasn't it?"</p>
    <p>"Have you been staying here for long?" Kim asked. </p>
    <p>"A little while now, yes," the professor said. "Field research trip." He shook one of his big brown boots demonstratively. </p>
    <p>Kim waited for him to elaborate.</p>
    <p>He did not. </p>
    <p>"What do you study?" Kim asked finally. "Oysters?"</p>
    <p>"I'm an anthropologist," he said, apologetically. "Sorry, I should have said. I'm so scattered today!" </p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="int">DATA COLLECTOR:</span> He must be here to study the Six Soleils. </p>
    <p>"My name is Ali," he said, extending a hand. "Alexei Volya." </p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="int">DATA COLLECTOR:</span> So, Safre on Mom's side, Graad on Dad's, based on those names. </p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="int">VRAIMENT VACHOLIERE:</span> He's local. Hear those pinched "o" vowels? </p>
    <p>"Kim," he replied, shaking hands with the anthropologist. "Kitsuragi. It's nice to meet you, Mr. Volya." </p>
    <p>"What do you need the 'phone for?" Ali the anthropologist asked. </p>
    <p>"I am an officer with the RCM, back in the city," Kim said. The professor would know which city. Though they were far from Revachol proper, they were still in the Zone of Control—the farmers and fishermen of the Valènce Peninsula sided with the communards in the revolution, and joined the commune for 8 short years, and suffered the consequences ever since. They were loyal to their own region, but still united under the flag of the city. "I need to make a call to the local precinct."</p>
    <p>"Oh—there's nothing seriously wrong, I hope?" the anthropologist said anxiously.</p>
    <p>"I'm afraid one of the Dacha's guests has gone missing," Kim said. He lied on an impulse. Being vague could passively solicit information—people loved to fill in their own details for you. "There is reason to suspect foul play. A man named Armin."</p>
    <p>"Armin?" The anthropologist frowned, then a look of recognition came over his face. "Armin—you don't mean he's missing?" Kim nodded grimly. "Why, that's terrible. That's just awful..."</p>
    <p>"You knew him?"</p>
    <p>"Not well," the anthropologist clarified, though he looked rather upset. In all, he seemed to be a rather anxious person. "I saw him around the hostel."</p>
    <p>"Had he been here for a while, too?" Kim asked.</p>
    <p>"Yes," the anthropologist said. "Yes, he was here before I arrived."</p>
    <p>"And when was that?" Kim's fingers itched to take out his notebook.</p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> But we're <em>not </em>investigating. We're alerting the proper authorities. </p>
    <p>"Two months ago," Ali said. "Early February."</p>
    <p>"And when was the last time you saw him?" Kim inquired.</p>
    <p>"Well..." Alexei the anthropologist hesitated—"I didn't see him, exactly. But I heard him having a fight last night, with another man."</p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="int">DATA COLLECTOR:</span> Interesting. Very interesting.</p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> Ahem. </p>
    <p>Sensible heels clacked across the mosaic tile, announcing the return of manager Claudine. "Mr. Kitsuragi," she said. "How can I help you?" </p>
    <p>Kim gestured for Alexei to go first, and he registered a request for new towels. Finally, Kim stepped up to the desk.</p>
    <p>Kim sighed, raising his eyebrows at her. "Hi," he said. </p>
    <p>"Hi," Claudine the manager said, almost cracking something that could, on a very delicate instrument, register as a smile. "The photos."</p>
    <p>Kim put them back on the counter.</p>
    <p>"Thank you."</p>
    <p>"You had a second thing to ask."</p>
    <p>"Yes. I wondered if you would call another guest for me. I need to speak with him about this."</p>
    <p>"Certainly. Who?"</p>
    <p>"Harrier is his name. Harry. I don't know his surname."</p>
    <p>Claudine's mouth opened, then shut. "Harrier Du Bois?" </p>
    <p>"Could be," Kim said. "We played cards with the victim in the cafeteria last night. I don't know how well they knew each other, but he's a fellow RCM officer, so I thought I'd do him the courtesy of explaining the..."</p>
    <p>"Mr. Kitsuragi," she interrupted. "He already knows about it."</p>
    <p>"What?"</p>
    <p>"Mr. Du Bois was arrested for murder a half hour ago," she said.</p>
    <p>"Oh," was all Kim could think to say.</p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> Shit.</p>

    <p class="skill">NOISE COMPLAINT/DISTURBING THE PEACE</p>
    <p class="skill">11 APR, '51. 3:35 AM. </p>
    <p class="skill">RADIO CALL FROM DACHA HOSTEL APPX 3:30 AM. NOISE COMPLAINT FROM GUEST. </p>
    <p class="skill">2 MALE GUESTS ARGUING LOUDLY OUTSIDE HOSTEL (FRONT) AT A LOUD VOLUME. POSSIBLY DRUNK. </p>
    <p class="skill">CONSTABLE CALLED TO SCENE. ARR. 3:45 AM. FIGHT HAD DISPERSED. BOTH SUSPECTS GONE. </p>
    <p class="skill">NOISE FINES TO BE ISSUED IF REPEAT OFFENSE OCCURS, TO THE FOLLOWING:</p>
    <p class="choice">1. DUBOIS, HARRIER</p>
    <p  class="choice">2. VANMAUER, ARMIN</p>
    <p>Kim looked up from the so-called "incident report," which was scrawled on a yellow sheet of legal paper. "Constable," said Lt. Kitsuragi, with infinite patience, "on the strength of this minor incident, which you did not witness, you arrested Mr. Du Bois for a murder?" </p>
    <p>The three of them—Kim, Constable Bozeman, and the dog—were sitting in his office in the Hôtel de Ville—a crowded, carpeted space of repurposed military glory, which was lavishly decorated not with files, forms, nor certifications, but with fishing trophies. Creatures large and small were preserved in jars, stuffed on stands, and mounted on plaques. The dog trembled with the strain of staying still inside this cabinet of delights. The crowning catch was a massive Cerulean Sailfish, as long as an eight-year-old, displayed proudly over the Constable's desk chair. </p>
    <p>The Constable himself was tall, Ubi, and facially unremarkable. He was dressed in a denim shirt and tall leather boots that didn't seem appropriate for a rainy climate. Though he was probably younger than Kim, his face had the same creases as many Ifranians—the lines of premature aging brought on by thirty years of sun and sea. He was also missing one and a half fingers on his left hand. The Constable reclined behind his huge antique desk, hands behind his head, giving Kim an easygoing grin. It was obvious that this man's idea of how to do his job came primarily from boidadero paperbacks. </p>
    <p>"I am holding Mr. Du Bois as a person of interest, that's correct," he said. "I haven't served the charges officially yet. Few more i's to dot, t's to cross, first." </p>
    <p>"Such as?" said Kim. The strain of not telling him how to do his job was immense.</p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> Such as, I don't know, EXAMINING THE CORPSE?</p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="int">INTERPERSONAL ACUITY:</span> I do not think you should say that.</p>
    <p>"Well, I have to conduct some interviews," the Constable said, leaning forward to drum his fingers on the desk. "I'd welcome any help you can offer in that area, Detective. I'm a one-man force. And like I said, I've never investigated a murder before."</p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> That much is OBVIOUS.</p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="psy">BRAIN BOUNCER:</span> I'm not helping investigate. </p>
    <p>"Do you have the power to press charges?" Kim inquired with innocent curiosity, sidestepping the generous offer of unpaid vacation employment. "Forgive me. There is no rank of Constable in the RCM, and I'm not familiar with the legal code or municipal law in Valènce." </p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> And I detect no hint of any actual official FORMS or MANUALS in this office.  </p>
    <p>"Most of the crime I deal with gets the punishment of a minor fine. I've been Constable for nigh on 10 years now, and I've never had to press any charges worse than that. Folks around here tend to resolve disputes among themselves. For somethin' worse than a misdemeanor, I believe I'm supposed to send 'em to the Coalition courts—but I wouldn't even know how to do that. Who would I call? What would I do with the form? <em>Mail </em>it?" He laughed, as if the idea was ludicrous. </p>
    <p>"Detective, one thing you gotta understand about Ifrania is—this is a small, small town. There's hardly enough people to keep the grocery store in business. The grade school shut down from under-attendance. There's not even enough liquor to go 'round and start a drunken brawl. There's just work, rain, work, rain, three months of winter, and then more work. Major crimes—homicide? It's unheard of. Theft? There's hardly nothin' to steal." </p>
    <p>The Constable folded his hands in front of himself on the desk. "One thing I'll tell you, Detective, about this murder—it was not done by one of ours. This was an out-of-towner, killin' another out-of-towner. Nobody 'round here would do anything like this."</p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> I... I don't even know where to begin, with that speech.</p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="int">INTERPERSONAL ACUITY:</span> Maybe ask a clarifying question? 'How did you end up with this job? Were you literally the only person who wanted it?'</p>
    <p>"What does ... Mr. Du Bois have to say about last night?" </p>
    <p>"Well that's the kicker," said the Constable. He leaned back in his chair again. "You'll like this. He says he doesn't remember it. Blacked out."</p>
    <p class="skill">HARRIER DU BOIS, SOBER COP: <em>"I can't drink liquor anymore because of my liver. If I have another drink, I could die." </em></p>
    <p>"Funny, you two RCM fellas both being here at the same time. You really don't know each other?"</p>
    <p>"No. We work in different precincts," Kim said. "Our paths have never crossed before."</p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="psy">VOLTA DO MAR</span> (challenging—failure): Probably.</p>
    <p>The Constable took Kim down to speak with the accused. The town lockup was in the basement of the Hôtel de Ville, and it consisted of a handful of small cells, bars and walls painted a pleasant seafoam teal. The space was dark, with low ceilings and little porthole windows, like the brig of a ship. </p>
    <p class="skill">IFRANIA-DU-ROI: Originally a drunk tank for soldiers who got too rowdy on leave. 100 years and two revolutions later, it's still used for almost the exact same purpose. </p>
    <p>The man in the cell isn't sitting like a drunk. He doesn't seem to notice Kim or the Constable enter the space. He's sitting with his back against the bars, one hand loosely gripping a bar, looking up at his porthole window, just out of reach. </p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> Lost in thought. Thinking about how he got here. He doesn't really understand it. There's not much data to work with. He's still getting used to that. He's still getting used to everything. </p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="fys">VICE:</span> Was he drunk last night, after all? Was he lying?</p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="int">INTERPERSONAL ACUITY:</span> I didn't think so. But sometimes I'm not good at recognizing when people are lying.  </p>
    <p>"What's on your mind, Mr. Du Bois?" the Constable asks, voice echoing down the concrete corridor. </p>
    <p>"Death," says Harrier, without turning around. </p>
    <p>"What about it?" Kim asks. </p>
    <p>"I've been wondering if I already died, and I'm stumbling around the afterlife. I haven't found any evidence for this theory, I admit. But I haven't found any against it either." </p>
    <p>Finally, he turns around to look at them through the bars. When he sees Kim, he frowns, placing him.<em> So he does remember at least one thing from last night. </em></p>
    <p>"Kim?" he says. </p>
    <p>"Harrier," Kim replies. </p>
    <p>"Harry," he corrects. "What are you doing here? Was it you who made the noise complaint last night?" </p>
    <p>"No," Kim says, coming closer to the cell. Harry looks up at him from the floor. "I'm the person who discovered the body." </p>
    <p>Harry glances uneasily around Kim's legs at the Constable, who waits at the end of the corridor, hands in pockets. </p>
    <p>Kim crouches down so he's at Harry's eye level. "I'm sorry about your friend," he says. </p>
    <p>Harry says nothing. </p>
    <p>"Detective," Kim says, drawing Harry's attention back to him—another frown— "There's something I neglected to tell you last night. I too am with the RCM. Precinct 57." He hands Harry his badge through the bars. </p>
    <p>Harry takes it without a word and examines it at length, seeming to read every word and number. </p>
    <p>"Why didn't you tell me?" Harry asks finally. </p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="int">DATA COLLECTOR:</span> The question contains no mistrust—only curiosity.</p>
    <p>Kim hesitates. "I'm on vacation," he says finally. "I didn't think it would be important. I'm sorry I wasn't more forthcoming with you." </p>
    <p>Harry hands the badge back to Kim. "That's okay. I had a feeling about you. Now I know why." </p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> He doesn't recognize you. </p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="int">INTERPERSONAL ACUITY:</span> That's a relief.</p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="int">DATA COLLECTOR:</span> That's a disappointment. </p>
    <p>"Why don't you tell me about last night, Detective?" Kim says, kneeling on one knee. This position makes him acutely aware of how sore and cold his feet and calves still are. His socks are still wet, wool clinging to his skin inside his boots. "What happened between you and Armin after the card game?" </p>
    <p>"Where did you find him?" Harry asks, sidestepping Kim's questions. </p>
    <p>"...I found his body on the beach," Kim says. "Near the Six Soleils."</p>
    <p>"How long since death?" </p>
    <p>"Hard to say," Kim says, wishing he had a concrete number. "I estimated between 2 and 6 hours." A pause. "Do you have an alibi for this morning, Detective?"</p>
    <p>Harry shrugs. "I was in my room at the hostel. Trying to sleep." </p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> So no alibi.</p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="int">DATA COLLECTOR:</span> But surely people saw his comings and goings inside the building. We can find someone who corroborates, or contradicts. </p>
    <p>"Detective..." Kim says. He wants to impress the seriousness of the situation onto the detective, but for some reason, his instinct is to be gentle with the man. He seems inexplicably fragile, or volatile—like the person he sees now is just a thin skin stretched over a vacuum, and a tear or a puncture in that façade will unleash that terrible emptiness. </p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="psy">COMPASSION:</span> He's newly sober. You've seen this before, plenty of times, in convicts and colleagues and acquaintances in the Underground. The rawness of a fresh start, the confusion and vulnerability. Nowhere to hide from your guilt. Do him the courtesy of addressing his present-day self only. </p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="psy">BRAIN BOUNCER:</span> You've seen this plenty of times—and you've rarely seen it last long. </p>
    <p>"...Harry," Kim says. "Did you and Armin get into a fight last night?" </p>
    <p>"I don't know," Harry says miserably.</p>
    <p>"Do you think you did?"</p>
    <p>"No. He's an asshole, but he..." The sentence trails off. "I mean, he was an asshole." </p>
    <p>Time to ask the big question. "You say you don't know, not yes or no. Why? You don't remember?"</p>
    <p>Harry looks up at the porthole window again, like his lines might be written there. "No, I don't remember getting into a fight. I remember playing cards with you and Armin, then going for a walk, then going back to my room late at night. I slept terribly, and I had dreams. I don't remember all of them, and maybe Armin was part of them. That's what I remember." </p>
    <p>"Then why didn't you say that to the Constable, when he arrested you?" Kim asks in an undertone. </p>
    <p>"Because my memory isn't trustworthy," Harry says, with another bolt of that disarming frankness. He turns his head against the pale blue bars to look Kim in the eyes, hardly an arm's reach away. His eyes are big and gray-green—not bloodshot or hungover, just very tired. He looks as exhausted as Kim feels. "A month ago, I drank myself into total amnesia. I woke up not knowing who I was or where I was. Didn't remember anything about history, geography, my family, the Pale, the RCM, not a single thing. It's all gone." </p>
    <p><em>I'm wondering if I already died, and I'm stumbling around the afterlife. I admit I haven't found any evidence for it, but I haven't found any evidence against it, either. </em></p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="psy">VOLTA DO MAR </span>(challenging—success): He is a wanderer in the graveyard of his own life. A stranger in his own world. A convict who broke out of the clutches of death and returned to the world of the living, only to find it unrecognizable. </p>

    <p class="skill"><span class="fys">SHIVERS:</span> No, not exactly. </p>
    <p>Kim meets his gaze, listening silently. He schools his expression, but it must show some of the sadness, because Harry sits up a little straighter, and leans a little closer, like he's tuning into Kim's frequency.</p>
    <p>"I haven't touched a drop of alcohol for a month—I swear it, Lieutenant, tox-screen my blood, make me walk in a straight line, ask at the liquor store and the pub in town—they've never seen my face. What I told you last night is true. I know the next drink could kill me."</p>
    <p>"So..."</p>
    <p>"So no, I don't think I got in a fight with Armin last night and killed him in a fit of rage. But that doesn't mean that I didn't." </p>
    <p>Kim takes a long moment to process this, his eyes locked with Harry's. </p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> His story checks out, but it's messy. We don't like messy. </p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="int">INTERPERSONAL ACUITY:</span> This person is volatile and a liability. Do not get involved. </p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="psy">COMPASSION:</span> This person needs help. He is a man adrift.</p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="psy">BRAIN BOUNCER:</span> That doesn't mean he needs <em>your </em>help. You owe him nothing. </p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> You owe him professional courtesy. Be direct. </p>
    <p>"Do you think that you would do it?" Kim asks.</p>
    <p>A pause. </p>
    <p>"No," Harry says. </p>
    <p>	<span class="int">INTERPERSONAL ACUITY:</span> But...</p>
    <p>"...But?" </p>
    <p>"...But I don't know myself very well." </p>
    <p class="skill"> <span class="int">CONCEPTUALIZATION</span> (challenging—failure): Wow. What must that be like? </p>
    <p>Kim exhales. "All right, detective," he mutters.</p>
    <p>"What do you think I should do?" Harry asks in an undertone. </p>
    <p>"I think you should wait here a moment," Kim says, gathering himself and standing abruptly. His back and leg muscles wail in protest. His cold socks slip on the insoles his boots. "Constable."  </p>
    <p>"Detective?" </p>
    <p>"Could we speak upstairs?" </p>
    <p>Kim led the way up. He knew that his interpersonal instincts were not always trustworthy, though they tended to run the other way—mistrust when none was warranted, unfounded suspicions that were never borne out—rather than this—trust where none was apparently warranted, a sense that this man didn't belong in this situation. And yet, in this situation, he was inclined to sympathize with the stranger. </p>
    <p>The dog was waiting loyally in the lobby of the empty HDV; the antique mosaic floor was mostly covered with utility rugs, and there were various town notices and handwritten flyers posted all around. The dog jumped up and wagged its tail at their arrival. Kim positioned himself beside it, taking advantage of the intimidation factor of a large canid. </p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="int">INTERPERSONAL ACUITY:</span> Cons to putting yourself on the line for this complete(?) stranger: He obviously has a lot of baggage, people around him treat him like he's an idiot, alcoholic, probably unstable, 75% chance of it ruining your vacation.</p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> On the other hand—you hate vacation.</p>
    <p class="skill">VACATION KIM: Aw, what?</p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> And you're in a position to help. It would be the right thing to do.</p>
    <p>"Constable."</p>
    <p>"Yessir."</p>
    <p>"I've been a homicide detective for 5 years. In that time, do you know how many cases I've cleared?"</p>
    <p>"...Cleared?"</p>
    <p>"Produced and charged a likely suspect. Cleared. Not solved, but found a suspect to charge in the first place."</p>
    <p>"Uh..."</p>
    <p>"I'll give you a hint," Kim said. "My case load is about one murder case every 1.5 weeks. 390 cases, give or take a few."</p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="int">DATA COLLECTOR:</span> 390 exactly, 391 counting this one (which we are not counting). </p>
    <p>"250?" the Constable ventured.</p>
    <p>Kim shook his head.</p>
    <p>"300?" the Constable offered.</p>
    <p>"102," said Kim flatly. "My clearance rate is 16%. And that puts me in the 98th percentile for all RCM officers. Statistically, the chances that this murder case will ever be solved are abysmally low. Last year, 71% of the murders in Revachol went completely unsolved. Do you see now that you may have acted hastily, Constable, in arresting the first person to cross your mind? Do you think perhaps the issue warrants a bit more time and consideration than that? Or do you perhaps think that you are an untapped genius in the field of homicide investigation? A prodigy? That perhaps you will be the first law officer in the Zone of Control whose homicide clearance rate is 100%?"</p>
    <p>The Constable's expression had frozen, one eye slightly widened in alarm. Kim remained in the same position, hands clasped in front, looking up at the officer through his glasses. </p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="int">INTERPERSONAL ACUITY:</span> There's more to say, but instead of offering a way out, I think I'll let him dangle. </p>
    <p>Kim stared at him expressionlessly. Finally, the Constable sputtered—</p>
    <p>"No—Detective, I didn't think so, but I—"</p>
    <p>"Lieutenant," Kim corrected him.</p>
    <p>"Lieutenant. I—"</p>
    <p>"We both report to the MI," Kim said. "I suggest consulting regulation if you really wish to bring charges against Detective Du Bois. And if you do, you will need to issue a station call containing the evidence. And as a word of friendly advice, Constable Bozeman, hearsay from one witness does not constitute sufficient evidence for charges of murder."</p>
    <p>"Two," the Constable managed to spit out. He looked blotchy and embarrassed, but surprisingly enough, it seemed he was not the sort of person who got angry when they were embarrassed. He just seemed to shrink in size and years. "Two witnesses."</p>
    <p>"I suggest you interview them," Kim said, unclasping his hands and picking up the dog's leash. </p>
    <p>"Wait—" the Constable said. "Hang on. I—I can't just let him go."</p>
    <p>Kim looked back up at him with a raised eyebrow. The man looked prepared to stand his ground. </p>
    <p>He waited. More often than not, people would talk themselves into a corner if you just gave them the space. They would fill in your words for you if you let them. Wielding authority involved more silence than speech. </p>
    <p>"I can't," the Constable said again. "His arrest is on record. If I let him go, that means I'm dropping the charges. What if he skips town?" </p>
    <p>"Serve him a station call," Kim repeated. "If you officially press charges, and he skips town, he'll be a fugitive from the law."</p>
    <p>"But I don't have the forms."</p>
    <p>"You do," Kim said. "They're in your office. Let's go."</p>
    <p>After much ado, they found the station call slips ("Mandatory Sentencing" was what they called it in Valènce) and the Constable filled one out with Harry's information. They pinned the slip, with carbon copy still attached, to the board behind the Constable's desk. Then they returned to the basement lockup, dog in tow.</p>
    <p>This time, Harry stands, looking from Kim to the Constable, trying to gauge what's happened. Kim holds out his hand wordlessly, and the Constable places the key on his glove. Kim unlocks Harry's cell. </p>
    <p>"What's going on?" asks Harry the Sober Cop. "He's letting me go? What did you say to him?" </p>
    <p>"I cut you a deal," Kim says, in an undertone that only Harry can hear. </p>
    <p>"What?"</p>
    <p>Kim opens the heavy door. Harry still stands inside the cell.</p>
    <p>"I'm free to go?" he says.</p>
    <p>"The Lieutenant here helped me to uh, to review some regulations," the Constable says. "I find myself lacking in the requisite amount of evidence to bring charges at this time, Mr. Du Bois. I do however have the ability to issue an uh, a mandatory sentencing slip, or a station call, I believe, is what you call them in the city. As such, I have filled one out for you. However..." He glances at Kim— "In an unofficial capacity... Due to your position as a police detective... and my position as a... uh... person who has not solved many murder cases—" Another glance at Kim— "...Any murder cases, that is, not having had the uh, the opportunity... I can offer you, and your, uh, colleague here, the opportunity to clear your name. If you can provide me with a clear alibi for the timeframe of Armin Van Mauer's death, that is to say, the hours between midnight last night and 11 AM this morning, then I will take the station call slip down in my office, and the carbon copy, and burn them both in the incinerator. Detective," he concludes. </p>
    <p>Harry continues to stare. "...Right. So I'm free to go, then?" </p>
    <p>"If you leave town, the station call will be posted," Kim clarifies. "And if you fail to produce an alibi, the station call will be posted." </p>
    <p>Harry turns his eyes on Kim. "And you're going to help me?" he clarifies.</p>
    <p>"Yes," Kim says. </p>
    <p>"Why?" Harry asks.</p>
    <p>Kim raises an eyebrow at him, where the Constable can't see. </p>
    <p>"Okay," Harry says, finally. "Sounds like a deal." </p>
    <p>He holds out his hand, and the Constable steps forward to shake it. Then he steps back, and takes his key back from Kim. He looks from one RCM officer to the other, then down at the dog, then nods stiffly, and says, "I'll leave you to it, then, fellas. Officers." </p>
    <p>He leaves.</p>
    <p>"Kim, what the hell did you say to him?" Harry asks as soon as he's gone. "You scared him shitless." </p>
    <p>Kim gives a small shrug. </p>
    <p>Harry looks impressed.</p>
    <p>Still, he does not move from the cell. </p>
    <p>"Are you going to come out?" Kim asks. "You're free to go."</p>
    <p>"Free-ish," Harry corrects, looking around the cell as if searching for its non-visible, metaphysical boundaries. "I'm not allowed to leave town."</p>
    <p>"Until you produce a credible witness," Kim corrects. "Preferably more than one. That should not be difficult, I don't think."</p>
    <p>"You don't?"</p>
    <p>"No," says Kim. "I am a seasoned investigator. As are you, I take it?"</p>
    <p>Harry nods. "Being a detective is pretty much the only thing I know how to do." His eyes are still scanning the lateral edges of the teal box. "You know what we could do, actually, Kim—? You know what would really clear my name?" </p>
    <p>"What's that, Detective?" </p>
    <p>"Solve the murder," Harry says, his gaze landing on the porthole window. On the other side, night is falling. Flecks of rain rest on the glass. "Catch the real killer." </p>
    <p>"So you don't think it's you, then," Kim says bluntly.</p>
    <p>"No way to be sure," Harry says, eyes on the window. "But if it is me, I should be locked up, right?" </p>
    <p>Kim is unclear about where this conversation is going. "Yes," he confirms. "That is how the legal system works." </p>
    <p>"Do you think it's me?" Harry counters. </p>
    <p>"...No, Detective, I don't," Kim says. </p>
    <p>"Why not?" Harry asks. </p>
    <p>"Because usually, the correct solution is the least complicated solution," Kim says. "And 'least complicated' does not describe you or your situation."</p>
    <p>Harry snorts appreciatively. </p>
    <p>"Amnesiac detective with a binge drinking problem," Harry says. "I guess not." </p>
    <p>That nudges something in Kim's memory. </p>
    <p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> You have to admit, that sounds familiar, somehow, doesn't it? He's certainly not going to be the one who remembers... </p>

    <p>"Detective, is there something special about that window?" Kim asks, clasping his hands behind his back. </p>
    <p>"No," Harry says. "Just looking in case I need to get used to the view."</p>
    <p>It doesn't seem like that's the real answer, but Kim lets it pass. "Come on," he says. "Let's go." With that same strange reluctance, Harry walks out of his cell, and Kim locks it behind him. </p>
    <p>Kim's sleep that night was long and restless, a series of creatively designed nightmares strung together by the steady patter of rain on his window and the roar of the stormy sea. The usual street racing nightmare transitioned seamlessly into nightmares of Armin van Mauer's maimed face, the hole in his cheek tunneling through his brain. Armin spoke to him but Kim couldn't hear what he said. Then the hole appeared in the faces of other victims—Kim's aunt, Yves, Captain Delaney, kids from Kim's juvie cop days, kids he hadn't seen in a decade—probably parents now themselves, or dead in reality. In the dreams, he was responsible for each death in a different way, by fault or by inaction. He heard barking, but when he woke, he was alone; the dog slept in the stables. </p>
    <p><em>I don't usually have this many nightmares,</em> he reflected, lying in bed in the weak light of dawn. The car crash dream was usually enough for his anxiety to make its point. Perhaps this was an effect of proximity to l'émergence. Perhaps this was the cost of forgetting in his conscious hours. Despite the stress, he felt enlivened and awake as he left his room that morning, like the relief of throwing up after hours of nausea.</p>

    <h2>Day 4</h2>
<p><em>TO DO:</em></p>
<p class="notebook"><em>1. Find satisfactory alibi for Det. HDB</em></br> 2. Recollect previous meeting w HDB</em></p>
<p>Kim opens to a new page in his vacation-turned-investigation notebook, and slides two coffee mugs and a bowl of sugar out of the way so Harrier can see the page. "Let's make a list of what you do remember," Kim says, "to start with." </p>
<p>"All right," says Harrier, still chewing his breakfast sausage. They're sitting in the mostly empty cafeteria of the Dacha Hostel, at a tiny cafe table. The time is 0800 hours. He takes Kim's proffered pen and starts writing. Kim watches for a moment, reading his bullet points upside-down. By the third list item, Kim sees the problem.</p>
<p>"Ah, Detective," Kim says. "I meant what you remember about <em>yesterday.</em>"</p>
<p>Harry looks up. "Oh," he says. "Aren't we investigating?" </p>
<p>His notes read: </p>
<p class="notebook"><em>- 5'10", ~180lbs</em></br><em>- Brown hair, receding </em></br><em>- Graad originally but grew up in</em></p>
<p>"We are investigating <em>you,</em>" Kim says. "We are not investigating the death of Armin van Mauer. We don't have the jurisdiction."</p>
<p>Stymied, Harry looks down at his list. "Oh." </p>
<p>Pause. </p>
<p>"But..."</p>
<p>"The deal was for us to clear <em>your </em>name," Kim says, taking the notebook back. He flips to the next blank page. "By finding your alibi. You say you were nowhere near the gorge at the time of the murder. I believe you. We need proof. We need somebody who saw you, preferably multiple someones, at multiple times, nice and spread out." Kim divides the new page with a vertical line. "I would also like to find out more about your argument with the victim, and why you can't remember it."</p>
<p>Harrier the sober cop stares at him like he's doing long division in his head for a completely unrelated problem. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> Evaluation of Officer Du Bois's competence is pending. Check back at end of day.</p>
<p>"Who's going to investigate the death?" Harry finally asks. </p>
<p>"I don't know," Kim says. "The local force is unequipped, and the nearest authorities are currently unreachable. Failing anything else, we can send them a letter or go to the port by omnibus." These ideas are both unappealing for a number of reasons. Kim wishes for a long-distance 'phone or radio. Traveling out here is like traveling back in time. </p>
<p>"So you want to alert the 'authorities'?" Harry says, with evident skepticism.</p>
<p>"Yes," says Kim. </p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Because it's the correct thing to do, Detective," Kim says steadily. "We are officers of the RCM, not vigilantes." </p>
<p>Kim begins to label his chart. Left column: <em>HDB. </em>Right column: <em>Witness. </em></p>

<p>Chart complete, he looks up expectantly at Harrier. "We finished the card game at around 10. I saw you at the front desk with Claudine. Where did you go next?"</p>
<p>"I went out for a walk," Harrier says, "to stretch my muscles before going to sleep. No access to the old anesthetic." He smiles sheepishly. "I went down the hill, went to the general store, stayed there for a while, chatting with the clerk; wandered around the docks in the dark, shot the shit with some old drunks, came back."</p>
<p>"Did they give you anything to drink?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>Kim is writing. "And about what time did you come back?" </p>
<p>Harry <em>pff</em>s indecisively, the nonverbal Revacholian expression of the inexpressible. "Two hours, maybe. Around midnight... No, it must have been after midnight, because Claudine wasn't at her desk." </p>
<p>Kim makes note. </p>
<p>"And did you speak with anyone when you came back?" </p>
<p>Harry scratches his head. "Think so. Yeah. That rich guy was having a drink at the bar. He tried to get me to join him."</p>
<p>"But you didn't?" </p>
<p>Harry shakes his head. </p>
<p>Kim makes note. </p>
<p>"Then?" </p>
<p>"Then, I went to bed." Harry thinks deeply, staring at the ceiling. Recovering these relatively recent memories seems to be a laborious task. "I slept... badly. No, that was last night. No, that was the night before last." He looks back down. "I always sleep badly." </p>
<p>"Withdrawal," Kim comments. </p>
<p>Harry nods. </p>
<p>"It should get easier in another month or so," Kim says, looking back down at his notes. "Did you check the hour during the night?"</p>
<p>"Many times." </p>
<p>"Do you remember 3 AM? Any time between 3 and 4?"</p>
<p>Harry shakes his head. "No. I must have drifted off around then. Hey, do you think it's possible I sleepwalked?" </p>
<p>"Do you have a history of sleepwalking?"</p>
<p>Harry shrugs in an exaggerated manner. </p>
<p>"Right," says Kim. "You don't know." He sighs. "I suppose anything is possible." </p>
<p>"Especially in a place like this," Harry adds. </p>
<p>"A place like what, Officer?" </p>
<p>"L'émergence."</p>
<p>"We're not in l'émergence right now. The frontière is another kilometer to the northeast." </p>
<p>He nods towards the map of Ifrania, framed on the wall above the fireplace. A purple mist, grainy and light like chalk dust, falls diagonally over the tip of the tiny cape, covering l'Ile des Soleils, the swamp to the north that he'd hiked through yesterday, and the eastern beaches. </p>
<p>Harry doesn't turn to look. He just shakes his head. "The boundary shifts all the time; anyway, no modern instruments are finely tuned enough to measure where it begins and ends. You think a kilometer makes a difference to the Pale? Pale doesn't care. Everyone likes to <em>say</em> that l'émergence comprises the 50 kilometers around Porch Collapse, but where does it say Pale follows neat multiples of ten? Nevermind the human metric system. That's information. You know it <em>hates</em> that." Harry shakes his head again. "No way. Palestorms hit Ifrania sometimes, right? That means it's part of the zone. We're in l'émergence right now, man." </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">BRAIN BOUNCER:</span> That's terrifying.</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="fys">SPEED DEMON N° 1111:</span> That's cool.</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="int">DATA COLLECTOR:</span> So, the amnesiac is some kind of expert on the Pale? </p>
<p>"You have an interest in entroponetics, Detective?" Kim asks, sidestepping the outlandish hypothesis. </p>
<p>"You don't think my theory is worth pursuing?" Harry counters, sidestepping the sidestep. </p>
<p>"No, I don't think 'The Pale made me do it' will hold up in a court of law," Kim says, looking back down at his notebook. </p>
<p>"The Pale will do worse before it's all over. You can count on that," Harry says. </p>
<p>Kim decides not to react to this prognostication. </p>
<p>"Well, I don't know how much you remember from your Pale-related reading, Detective, but there <em>are </em>a couple recorded cases of murder during psychosis induced by prolonged Pale exposure. However, those were committed by people with hundreds of hours of exposure—repeater workers, aerostatic pilots, paledrivers. I don't think that precedent applies to your case."</p>
<p>"But it could potentially apply in the murderer's case," Harry insists. "What about someone losing their sanity after living their whole life in l'émergence?" </p>
<p>"Lots of people live in or near the zone d'émergence for their entire lives," Kim says. "In the Semenine Islands, for instance, on Sereglee and Banaital." </p>
<p>Harry hmms thoughtfully. "I'll have to do more research."</p>
<p>"You won't," Kim says, "because you are not investigating this murder. Let's return to what you <em>are </em>investigating, which is your alibi. You slept. Tell me what times you remember."</p>
<p>"2:30-ish, 4:41, 5:10, 5:40, 6:00..."</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">COMPASSION:</span> He really sleeps badly. </p>
<p>"What time did you get up?" Kim asks. </p>
<p>"Around 7," Harry says. "I hate waking up in the dark."</p>
<p>"Did you leave your room?" </p>
<p>"Yes," Harry says, "I had breakfast with one of the other guests. He's an older ex-military guy. Valentin." </p>
<p>At that hour, Kim was already trekking north. "Until?" </p>
<p>"Probably 8?" </p>
<p>They were now nearing the outer edge of the timeframe. "And then?" </p>
<p>"Listened to the milieus in the book nook," Harry says, pointing towards it. It was the same shelf from which Kim had pilfered his embarrassing book at 6:30 AM yesterday.  </p>
<p>"What did you hear?"</p>
<p>"It was a kids' show," he says. "There was a kid listening. Little girl. I let her choose. It was about talking animals who live on a magical island and teach you Walder. She got bored of that after a couple minutes, and switched it over to BCN. It was some anthropologist being interviewed. She was talking about the history of cannibalism in Mundi. I thought it was a little gory for a kid, but she seemed to be into it." </p>
<p>"Did you listen to the whole program?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"So until 9."</p>
<p>"Then a quiz show came on." </p>
<p>"Did you stay to listen to it?" </p>
<p>"No. I hate those." </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> (challenging—success) He used to be really good at trivia. Now he sucks at it, and he's bitter about that. </p>
<p>"Went for a walk. I said hi to Henri on the way out, he'll remember, 'cause I annoy him. Then I went down to the bay and poked around on the beach for a while. 'Til noon. Plenty of fishermen down there probably saw me. Then I came back here and listened to some more radio in my room... Then I got arrested for murder. That was around 4 PM. Does that cover everything?"</p>

<p>"So, you do not have an interest in entroponetics, I take it?" Harry says, as Kim finishes underlining the blank spaces they needed to fill with information. "You never ponder the Pale?" </p>
<p>"I'm a police detective, so, no," says Kim. </p>
<p>"Ah," Harry says, taking a sip of his coffee. He has already added a teeth-rotting volume of sugar to it. "A man of concrete facts. A student of the physical laws."</p>
<p>Kim offers no comment. </p>
<p>"So why come here?" Harry asks. </p>
<p>Kim looks up from his notes. "Here?"</p>
<p>"To the peninsula. To Ifrania. This is the closest civilian-inhabited point to the Pale in the ZoC."</p>
<p>Kim looks at the detective for a moment. "That may be true, but it's not why I came," he says. "It wasn't my idea. I wanted a place to hike, and someone at the precinct suggested the Cliffs of Valènce. The bus fare is cheap, and so is the accommodation." </p>
<p>"Do you hike a lot with your dog?" </p>
<p>Kim looks back down at his notes. "No," he says. </p>
<p>"It's not your dog, is it?" </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">BRAIN BOUNCER:</span> How the hell did he know that?</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">COMPASSION:</span> Because you don't like the dog, and it's very obvious. </p>
<p>"What makes you say so?" Kim asks, not looking up.</p>
<p>"You never called her by name when we were walking back from the lockup last night. I didn't see you pet her, either. She likes you, though," he adds, "Even though you don't like her."</p>
<p>"It would be foolish for me to dislike a dog," Kim says, flipping to a new page to make an ordered list of witnesses and potential witnesses. </p>
<p>"What breed is she?"</p>
<p>"Königsteiner Tervuren."</p>
<p>"What's her name?"</p>
<p>"It's not important," Kim says. </p>
<p>"Who's her owner?"</p>
<p>"I am," Kim says, finally looking up. "It's my dog, Detective."</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> He could tell it was a sensitive topic. He was just trying to see how far he could get. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="int">DATA COLLECTOR:</span> This guy is persistent. He doesn't miss signs of discomfort in his witness, the way I do sometimes—he pretends to miss them. A keen data collector himself. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">BRAIN BOUNCER:</span> Keen or not, he'd better knock it off.</p>
<p>"That's fine, I'll just ask her what her name is myself," Harry says. "She's coming with us, right?" </p>
<p>"It wouldn't be right to leave her cooped up in the stables all day, so yes," Kim says, ignoring the detective's implication that he can speak Dog. "She won't be much help." </p>

<p>After they bus their breakfast dishes, Kim waits while Harry changes into his 'investigation getup,' which turn out to be the RCM blazer, a clean shirt lifted from the hostel lost and found, and a truly appalling necktie. The shirt looks like a woman's cut, but Harry doesn't appear to notice or mind. Kim feels uncomfortable going on duty—even pseudo-duty—with neither his uniform nor bomber. His off-duty jacket is his leather motorcycle jacket, which, while hardy and practical, does not give him the appearance of an authority figure. It gives him the appearance of a punk, or, at best, a middle-aged former punk. "Sweet jacket," Harry comments, admiring it as he adjusts his horrible tie (loosening it). </p>
<p>"You don't have your badge, do you?" </p>
<p>Harry shakes his head. "I didn't think I would need it on vacation."</p>
<p>"So between us, we have one badge, and one uniform—of sorts." </p>
<p>Harry tugs at his blazer, giving Kim a questioning look. "...Do... you want to wear it?"</p>
<p>"Um—no, Detective. Thank you." Kim clears his throat. "You should take the lead. You at least have the appearance of a detective, and it's your neck on the line."</p>
<p>Harry nods approvingly. "And you can be my intimidating bodyguard in the cool leather jacket." </p>
<p>"Let's not get carried away with the fantasy." Kim pockets his badge. "Where do you want to start?" </p>
<p>Harry ponders. "Think of a number between 1 and 6," he says.</p>
<p>Kim frowns. "Okay."</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>"2."</p>
<p>"Then we start with Mr. Moneybags Vesper," Harry says.</p>
<p>"Did you just choose randomly?" </p>
<p>"He was #2," says Harry. "You chose." </p>
<p>Kim's mouth opens to argue. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="int">LOGIC:</span> There's nothing strictly... wrong with that as an investigative method. But...</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="int">INTERPERSONAL ACUITY:</span> But it is wrong.</p>
<p>Kim shuts his mouth and follows Harry.</p>
<p>The wealthy Vespertine family is at a table in the cafe, eating breakfast and not looking impressed by the offerings. The preteen daughter, today wearing a checkered pinafore over a baby blue dress that matches her mother's, and rainbow barrettes in her blonde hair, surveys an anchovy with skepticism. Her father reads an auto magazine. </p>
<p>"No daily papers out here," he says without preamble or greeting as the detectives arrive.</p>
<p>"And is that a good thing, or bad thing, in your opinion, sir?" Harry inquires, clasping his hands behind his back like a waiter.</p>
<p>"It's splendid," he says, stroking his (equally splendid) mustache. "Liberation from the 24-hour news cycle is just what I have so desired. Open air, open space, peace and quiet... it's just marvelous." </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="int">CONCEPTUALIZATION:</span> (medium—failure) Am I seriously supposed to believe that these three stylish, well-fed people are walking around the muddy streets and rainy beaches of this single-cylinder fishing village—and enjoying it? </p>
<p>Kim glances at the wife to gauge her opinion on this 'peace and quiet'; she is not listening at all, but staring intently at her bowl of berries like it has secrets to tell. </p>
<p>He glances at the daughter instead. She's reading a thick hardcover book titled <em>Filippe the Squanderer: Opulence, Oppression, and Opiates.</em></p>
<p>"What can I do for you, officer?" </p>
<p>"Much obliged, sir. You can fill in some gaps in my memory. You see, I recently suffered from an acute encephalopathic event..."</p>
<p>The rich guy agreeably confirms Harry's midnight return, and even confirms that he heard him go upstairs to his room afterwards. Kim puts a check next to his name in the chart. The man also adds that Armin was nowhere to be seen in the common areas at that hour of the night. </p>
<p>"How late were you at the bar, sir?" Kim asks, looking up from his notebook. </p>
<p>The Vespertine man glances from Kim back to Harry, looking for confirmation that he should answer. "It's all right if your assistant asks questions?" </p>
<p>Kim's expression settles from polite interest to acute neutrality. </p>
<p>"Huh?" Harry says, seeming thrown off. </p>
<p>The Vespertine man nods towards Kim and raises his eyebrows at Harry again. </p>
<p>"My assistant?" Harry says, still seeming lost.</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="int">INTERPERSONAL ACUITY:</span> He's... playing dumb?</p>
<p>"Your ...associate?" the Vespertine man tries again, cheeks now slightly red. </p>
<p>Harry looks slowly around at Kim, as if he is expecting to see some other person standing at his elbow. "Oh!" he says, with exaggerated surprise. "You must mean Lieutenant Kitsuragi, the twice-decorated detective of the 57th precinct of the RCM. We must have forgotten to show him your badge, right, Kim?"</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> What the hell is going on?</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="int">INTERPERSONAL ACUITY:</span> Euh... </p>
<p>Kim, trying to keep his footing in this very surprising conversational power struggle, decides after a second's hesitation, to follow Harrier's lead—"Khm... Yes, it seems we did." </p>
<p>"Probably because he never asked to see mine," Harry adds cheerfully. "Don't you think?" </p>
<p>Kim stares from one white man to the other. "Probably, yes," he agrees. </p>
<p>"So probably he would be interested to see yours," Harry says, cheerful tone getting louder and louder, "And see your rank, and your years of service, and both your commendations, printed next to your foreign last name, in large, easy-to-read letters. Don't you think so?"</p>
<p>Harrier looks at M. Vesper with a wide, affable grin. The man's cheeks are distinctly pink. So are Kim's ears. He can feel them burning. </p>
<p>The two Samaran laborers at the next table are listening with frowns on their faces.</p>
<p>"I'm, er, terribly sorry, uh, Detective," the Vespertine says, to Kim's right lapel. "I certainly meant no—and should never have assumed—in Vesper I—" </p>
<p>"Lieutenant," Kim corrects calmly. Inside him, a powerful embarrassment is wrestling with a vicious, elated pride. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">BRAIN BOUNCER:</span> Keep a lid on it. </p>
<p>"Lieutenant—you see, I'm actually quite forward-thinking in—"</p>
<p>"My question, sir, was how late you were at the bar two nights ago," Kim repeats, as if nothing at all had happened. "We are trying to confirm Armin Van Mauer's movements at that time." </p>
<p>"Uh—I must have retired to bed around 1," he says, stroking his mustache in a self-soothing motion. "Darling, does that sound right to you?" </p>
<p>His wife has not been paying attention. "Hm?"</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="int">DATA COLLECTOR:</span> Unlike their daughter, who has been listening intently. She hasn't turned a page in several minutes.</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> Thank god Harrier is here to interrogate the kids instead of you. Hey, speaking of Harrier, did you see that? Holy shit. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="fys">SPEED DEMON N° 1111: That was badass! He humiliated him! <em>Crushed</em> him! </p>
<p>"So you did not hear an argument between Detective Du Bois and Mr. Van Mauer?" Kim confirms.</p>
<p>M. Vesper shakes his head. </p>
<p>"Nor did you, Miss?" Kim says, looking at the daughter. </p>
<p>"What's your name?" Harry asks.</p>
<p>"Sabine," says her mother. "Sabine, sit up straight and answer the police officer." </p>
<p>Sabine raises her head from her book and fixes Harry with the piercingly unimpressed gaze of a 12-year-old. </p>
<p>"You didn't hear any arguing outside the hostel in the middle of the night?" Harry asks.</p>
<p>"No, officer," Sabine says. </p>
<p>"And can you confirm that you have met Detective Du Bois before?" Kim says. "Yesterday morning?"</p>
<p>"Yes, officer," Sabine says.</p>
<p>"You listened to radio milieus together here in the Dacha?" Kim says.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"What about?" </p>
<p>"Learning Walder for children," she says. "That was boring, so I changed it to BCN."</p>
<p>"What was on?"</p>
<p>"An interview with Professor Kädri Malk," Sabine replies promptly. "She was discussing her new book about the history of human cannibalism in Mundi from pretermodern times to today. It's an underexplored area of history," she adds, "because modern Occidentals view cannibalism as a primitive practice particular to the 'uncivilized' peoples of other isolas. But in truth, it's perfectly safe, as long as you follow normal food safety precautions and don't eat anybody who had a prion disease. Many of the negative impacts associated with cannibalism are actually just symptoms of Tzaraath being transmitted within a closed population." </p>
<p>Kim retrieves his eyebrows from where they had climbed high above his glasses. In the four-adult silence that follows this speech, he checks off 8am-9am in the chart. </p>
<p>"That's splendid, darling," says Sabine's father, smiling encouragingly at his child. "We should all be more open-minded." </p>
<p>"Why do you let her listen to those things?" Sabine's mother hisses at her husband, as if the officers aren't there at all. "It's disgusting."</p>
<p>"She's an intellectual omnivore!" Sabine's father says jovially, his wife's rage rolling off him like water off an oily duck. "Just have to hope that didn't give her any ideas, ha-ha!" </p>
<p>Harry laughs along with him. Sabine seems satisfied with her effect on the adults and returns to her book. </p>
<p>They leave the Vespertines to their unsatisfying breakfast among the fishermen.</p>
<p>"Here's what bothers me," Harry mutters to Kim as they climb the steps back up to the lobby, "—what <em>are </em>they doing visiting this place? It's peaceful and quiet on the peninsula, sure, but let's be honest, as a town, it's kind of a shi—"</p>
<p>"Detective," Kim says, interrupting the rambling. Steeling himself, Kim turns to face the detective, and nudges his elbow so he'll look at him. "Thank you for sticking up for me back there." </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">BRAIN BOUNCER:</span> Just say it and move on. </p>
<p>"—Most RCM officers wouldn't have corrected someone like that, and if they had, they wouldn't have made a big deal out of it. It's not professional to humiliate an actual witness, but it's appreciated." </p>
<p>Harry frowns, and Kim tries to figure out what he's thinking. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="int">INTERPERSONAL ACUITY:</span> (medium--failure) Euh... Indeterminate.</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="int">DATA COLLECTOR:</span> You never know anything. You are so useless. The rest of us do all the work for you, do you know that?</p>

<p class="skill"><span class="psy">BRAIN BOUNCER:</span> No more than most of your colleagues, no more than before. Maybe it will be the last time he defends you like that. The only thing you know for certain is—you enjoyed it. </p>
<p>"Don't mention it," Harry says, smiling proudly. "Racism is a wedge used by the ruling classes to keep the workers from uniting against them. The bourgeoisie fall in line because they are afraid of losing what little they've hoarded. When the uprising comes, their petty prejudices won't protect them." </p>
<p>"Euh... yes. Well." </p>

<p class="skill"><span class="psy">VOLTA DO MAR:</span> What else would you be, if you came back from the dead with zero tools and had to construct a new life on the fly? </p>
<p>Harry claps him on the shoulder and the moment, mercifully, ends. Claudine is behind her desk, entering sums into her calculatrice with violent speed. They interview her next.</p>
<p>She confirms Harry's presence in the hostel at breakfast time the day before, around the time when the body was most likely being moved to the beach. As for the night before that, the night of the fight, she says she didn't see Harry herself.</p>
<p>"I just heard the fight," she says. </p>
<p>"You're the second witness?" Kim says.  </p>
<p>"That's me," Claudine says, looking at Harry. "I woke up and heard you two going at it, so I got out of bed and called the Constable on the radio." </p>
<p>"Could it have been another man?" </p>
<p>"I don't think it was, but I suppose it could have been," says Claudine, considering. "I'd have to hear his voice." </p>
<p>"I have no memory of the fight," Harry says, raising his hand like he's swearing in court. </p>
<p>"Were you drunk?" she asks bluntly. "You sounded drunk."</p>
<p>"I don't believe so, no," Harry says. "I have serious chlorosis of the liver, madame. My next drink could kill me. So I take care not to drink at all." </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> I take a lot of care, in fact. It's pretty much all I do all day. I wake up. I do not drink. Not a lot of room for other stuff, upstairs, downstairs, or in the middle. </p>
<p>"My... colleague's liver, aside, Ms. Adedayo, we are just trying to establish a clear timeline. You've been very helpful. Could you discern what the argument was about?" </p>
<p>She thinks. "It was something you both wanted. I suppose it might have been money. Or a woman. There was certainly a sense that one of you had double-crossed the other, or gone back on an agreement. I distinctly heard Armin say, 'I never agreed to that,' and you say, 'Yes you did!'" </p>
<p>Kim dutifully notes it down. </p>
<p>"So you called the Constable, and then the fight broke up of its own accord?" </p>
<p>"That's right."</p>
<p>"Did you hear—why? Why did we stop?"</p>
<p>"I think it came to blows. I heard scuffling. Then one of you backed off. Armin, I suppose, since you don't seem to be bruised." </p>
<p>Harry frowns, doing the math.</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="int">DATA COLLECTOR:</span> There was no bruise on Armin's face either. </p>
<p>"Where did we go after that?" </p>
<p>"You both left. Neither of you came back into the hostel."</p>
<p>"You never saw me come back in?"</p>
<p>"No," Claudine said. "The Constable came and went, and then I went back to sleep." </p>
<p>Harry drummed his large fingers on his chin thoughtfully. Then he shoved his hands in his pockets.</p>
<p>"The Constable interviewed the other witness, Alexei, didn't he?" When she nodded, he said, "Do you know where he is? We need to talk to him too."</p>
<p>"He's already gone out for the day," she said. "He's studying the Six Soleils. He walks there and back every day."</p>
<p>"Every day?" Kim says, looking up from his notes. He and Harry exchange a look. "Did he go yesterday?" </p>
<p>"Yes," she said, and at the same moment, Kim remembered seeing his muddy boots in the afternoon. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> Jackpot. Witness time. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">BRAIN BOUNCER:</span> Except how we're <em>not</em> investigating the murder. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> Khm. Of course. I meant for Harry's alibi. </p>
<p>"We'll have to catch him when he comes back," Harry says. "He might be a crucial witness. He could have seen the murderer moving the body, or even..."</p>
<p>"Khm." </p>
<p>Kim looks at him with a raised eyebrow. <em>Not investigating the murder. </em>Harry reluctantly trails off.</p>
<p>They conclude with Claudine and hunt around the hostel for Valentin, Harry's breakfast buddy from the day before. He's nowhere to be found. </p>
<p>They find Henri out back, in the stables. It's a dreary but dry day, crisp and cool. The barn is warmly lit, the cement floor is swept spotlessly, and the wireless is playing quiet music. Henri the surly teen is cleaning one of the horses' stalls, spreading fresh straw over the floor. Hearing their approach, Henri steps out of the stall and shuts the radio off. </p>
<p>"She's in that one down there," Henri says to Kim. "I caught her trying to dig out of that other stall through a gopher hole."</p>
<p>"Hi Henri," Harry says.</p>
<p>"Hi, Harry," Henri says, rolling his eyes. His jawgear really is huge. It orbits his head and mouth like a hoop skirt.</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="int">INTERPERSONAL ACUITY:</span> It's no wonder he hides out back here with the animals instead of around other people. Strangers and other kids are probably never nice to him. </p>
<p>"What were you listening to on the radio?" </p>
<p>"I dunno," he says, in a voice that communicates <em>none of your business. </em>"Uh, music?" </p>
<p>"Henri and I got off to a rocky start," Harry tells Kim in a faux-confidential manner. "I saw him reading a Nagatani comic, and in the course of our small talk, I <em>implied</em> that FoxMan could beat Nagatani in a fight—"</p>
<p>Henri is rolling his eyes again.</p>
<p>"—and ever since then, Henri has been rather <em>unimpressed</em> by my sense of taste." </p>
<p>Henri snorts. "Ridiculous to even..." he mutters under his breath. </p>
<p>"I did not understand any of the words you just said," Kim says to Harry.</p>
<p>Henri snorts again. Harry guffaws. The two of them exchange an 'Unbelievable!' look. </p>
<p>"Listen, H-man, did you see me yesterday morning?" Harry asks. "Kim is my colleague, we're looking into some stuff." </p>
<p>"Colleague?" Henri says. He looks at Kim with new interest. "You mean you're a detective too? Even though you're a—bino?" He remembers it's rude to say right in the middle of saying it, but it's too late.</p>
<p>"Yes," says Kim. "It poses some challenges. Mostly surrounding my other colleagues being condescending about it." </p>
<p>"Oh." Henri nods. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="int">INTERPERSONAL ACUITY:</span> He gets it. </p>
<p>The juvie script comes back to him, faded and patchy in some parts. Clearest where he had edited it himself, for his own sanity. "Sometimes my poor eyesight makes detecting difficult. That's why RCM officers work in pairs—to complement one another's weaknesses and strengths." Why is he being nice to the surly teen? No particular reason, it seems, other than that Harry started it. </p>
<p>"Why would you compliment someone's weaknesses?" Henri says.</p>
<p>"I bet you're wondering how cool it is to fight crime," Harry says, folding his arms and adopting a Cool Guy stance. "Well, we can tell you. It's pretty cool. The only thing cooler is to not do any crime at all, and become an artist." </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> ...What?</p>
<p>"Henri, can I ask you something?" Kim says, and Henri transfers his attention away from the bizarre person standing near them. "It's 10 o'clock on a weekday. Why aren't you in school?" </p>
<p>Henri takes his armful of straw and reenters the horse stall. "Our school closed the year before last," he says. "It was under-attended. Most parents make their kids work a few days a week. Everybody was failing. And the profs sucked. They say they're going to open it up again this fall. But they said that last fall." He rolls his eyes, which seems to be his form of punctuation. </p>
<p>"Well, that is highly illegal," Harry says, cheerfully. "Under the Coalition's charter for the Zone of Control. Although I'm sure you and the other kids love it." </p>
<p>"Yeah, it's great," Henri says sarcastically. "I love cleaning stalls and washing towels and bussing tables. I learn so much stuff, and I get to meet so many people my own age. It's really the life." </p>
<p>Kim clears his throat to prevent a laugh from escaping. </p>
<p>"And guess what?" Henri says, looking up from his task again. </p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Someone started using the school building as a barn for their horses. And other animals, too. Chickens. I think a llama. Don't even ask me where they got a llama. But it's not really meant for that... obviously... it's a school... So the animals are always escaping. I see the lady chasing after them. Her husband just lets them escape. He doesn't care." </p>
<p>"Lieutenant," Harry says to Kim, "I'm no longer confused about why the rich people are vacationing here. This town has everything." </p>
<p>Henri snorts down at the bed of straw. Harry smiles proudly. </p>
<p>"Why <em>are </em>they here?" Henri asks. "Actually, though." </p>
<p>"Why don't you ask them?" </p>
<p>From inside the stall, Henri makes a face at Harry. </p>
<p>"You could ask Sabine," Harry suggests.</p>
<p>"That would be weird."</p>
<p>"I don't think so," Harry says. "Why would that be weird?" </p>
<p>"I'm 14, and she's like, 10."</p>
<p>"It's normal to talk to other people," Harry says seriously. "I do it all the time." </p>
<p>Henri's face communicates everything he thinks about Harry and his relation to the concept of 'normal.' </p>
<p>The dog awaits in the last stall on the right, furthest from the front door. Her straw has already been changed, and she pants with pent-up canine energy. Harry peers over the slats. She wags her tail and barks at them expectantly. </p>
<p>"She wants out," Harry says.</p>
<p>"So you do speak Dog," Kim says mildly. He takes off his glove and snaps his fingers. </p>
<p>Harry leans his arms on the wooden slat, and rests his head comfortably on his elbow. Kim snaps at the dog again, and she sits—tail still wagging. When Kim opens the stall door, she hops up again, and Kim snaps—"Ah," he says warningly. She sits again, barely able to contain it, as he clips on the leash. Harry watches them. </p>
<p>"All right, I asked her what her name is," Harry announces behind him. "She says it's not the name you call her."</p>
<p>"Is that so?" says Kim.</p>
<p>"It is," Harrier says. "She says her true name is Canis Hodophilax."</p>
<p>A little laugh escapes Kim. He scratches his nose, trying to put the smile away. </p>
<p>"Holy hell—did you just laugh?" Harry's voice, behind him, is shocked. </p>
<p>"What did you say?" Kim asks with formidable control, turning around. </p>
<p>"You're smiling! I didn't think you could do that!" </p>
<p>Kim contains it as Canis Hodophilax leads him out of the stall to rejoin Harry. "Did she tell you anything else?"</p>
<p>"She told me that's her true name because she's the last of an extinct species of Seraseolitic wolf." </p>
<p>"Ah," says Kim. "Then you'd better tell her that she is from Königstein, just like all Königsteiner Tervurens." </p>
<p>"Police dogs," Harry says, after another pause. </p>
<p>"I am a police officer."</p>
<p>"But she's not a police dog," Harry says.</p>
<p>"No," Kim says, patiently. "She's my dog."</p>
<p>"Is that why you picked a Tervuren puppy?"</p>
<p>"Bernadette," Kim says.</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"Bernadette is her name," Kim says. "Now come on, Detective." </p>
<h3>*</h3>
<p>On a day like today, it's easy to remember how close the peninsula is to the Pale; a bay of matter shielding itself against the ocean of nothingness. The clouds over Oyster Bay are gray and close, a shroud overhead that feels like it's coming closer, floating down over the earth to cover them all. Only Bernadette the Königsteiner Tervuren doesn't care—she bounds over the beach like a bird, soaring over rocks and hurtling over docks. Harry walks a ways ahead of Kim, turning over flotsam and jetsam with his hideous shoes, and picking up empty bottles and interesting garbage. The land curves northward and paleward; to the left across the water, west, the mainland of Valènce is a gray blur of cliffs. A few boats dot the water between there and here. It's barely spring, and oyster planting won't start til the water gets warmer. For now, only fishermen brave the water, which is still frigid. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="fys">ENDURANCE:</span> As I am well aware. </p>
<p>Harry the Sober Cop stops to talk to every person they pass on the beach, and ask them if they remember seeing him yesterday morning, around the same time, in the same place. An old man with no teeth, a guy collecting tare, a woman repairing fishing nets, a girl collecting driftwood for unknown purposes. Most of them don't remember him. A few do. Harry recognizes all of them, and even knows some of their names, which strikes Kim, considering the other gaps in his working memory. </p>
<p>More checkmarks in his notebook. The timeframe narrows. </p>
<p>As they approach the marina, the beach transitions from wild to industrial with a high chain-link fence. </p>
<p class="notebook">UNAUTHORIZED PERSONNEL PROHIBITED</p>

<p>A wooden staircase takes them up the steep, eroded bank of coal-colored sand and back up to civilization. The stairs end on a rickety boardwalk alley between wooden shacks. They emerge from the shadows and into the center of town—the docks. It's immediately clear that <em>this</em> is where the action is. This is the heart of Ifrania. The door of the general store, MARCIN'S GENERAL STORE (Logo: Marlin. Slogan: "If we don't sell it, bonne chance!") opens and closes as they approach; a gang of kids hurries by, buckets in hands, mud splashing under boots; a group of older women sit around a bucket gutting eels, talking in Old Suresne. A heavy, rusting tractor—</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="mot">TORQUE DORK</span>:Magrave, at least 20 years old. Domestic manufacture? And still running? <em>Incroyable</em>. A silver fox...</p>
<p>—drags a boat on a trailer. The tractor's huge wheels squelch through a mud puddle and turn down the cement slope into the marina, trailer bouncing behind. Seagulls overhead announce their arrival at the bay. </p>
<p>"Shall we start with the shop?" Kim suggests. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="int">INTERPERSONAL ACUITY:</span> Consult the notebook, even though you already have the chart memorized. People find it weird when you remember facts about them. </p>
<p>"You were there at 10 PM," Kim reports. </p>
<p>"Right," Harry says, and leads the way.</p>
<p>The bell jingles to announce their arrival. The store has to be the most crowded place Kim's seen yet in Ifrania—</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="int">INTERPERSONAL ACUITY:</span> Too crowded. Leave.</p>
<p>—villagers shoulder-to-shoulder among the trenches of too-close white shelves with no apparent organizational system. About 25% of the shelves are empty. A compost-like smell emanates from the right, in the "fresh" produce section. No one notes their arrival except for the shop's cat, lounging on top of the nearest shelf of cans.</p>
<p>"Mrow." </p>
<p>Harry lets it smell his fingers before he scratches its head. The cat stretches upward appreciatively. </p>
<p>"Friend of yours?" Kim asks, as an annoyed-looking mother pushes past him with her shopping basket and toddler.</p>
<p>"My alibi, right here," Harry says, scratching under the cat's chin.</p>
<p>"Monsieur!" They both turn to see the man behind the counter, a young, tall, spindly-thin Iilmaraan man with curls spilling off the top of his high-and-tight haircut. He wears a white apron, a patterned kerchief around his neck, and little silver stud earrings in both ears. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="int">INTERPERSONAL ACUITY:</span> (medium—success) A comrade. </p>
<p>"Welcome back to the shop," the shopkeeper says to Harry with a smile. </p>
<p>"Hey, Marcin," Harry says, leaving the cat and edging his way to the cash register. He picks up a bottle of citrus-colored soda on the way. </p>
<p>"What can I get for you, monsieur, on such a lovely day as this?" </p>
<p>"This, and one pack of Astras, please." </p>
<p>Marcin takes a pack from under the counter and slides it over the glass with one finger. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> Take out the notebook and start asking questions about the other night. But first...</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="int">DATA COLLECTOR:</span> ...First let's observe the Marcin/Harry interaction for clues. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="fys">VICE:</span> Important clues. </p>
<p>"Would you really consider this to be a lovely day, Marcin?" Harry asks as he counts out his coins on the glass. </p>
<p>"No rain, the wind is brisk, and you have a friend to share a cigarette with," Marcin says, eyes flicking up to meet Kim's. "A perfect day, if you ask me." </p>
<p>Kim gives him a millimeter's eyebrow raise. </p>
<p>Marcin gives Kim half-of-a-half a smile. </p>
<p>"There." Harry slides the stack of counted coins across the counter. </p>
<p>"Merci," says Marcin. "Your cigarettes." </p>
<p>"Well, Marcin, it <em>would</em> be a perfect day if I was not accused of a heinous crime," Harry says with a weary sigh. Marcin's sculpted eyebrows rise. "But I'm hoping you can help me with that. This is my colleague, Lieutenant Kim Kitsuragi with the RCM. He's helping to verify my whereabouts the night before last."</p>
<p>Though they are already allies, they nod to each other.</p>
<p>"Of course, anything I can do to help, <em>gendarmes</em>," Marcin says. "What would you like to know?"</p>
<p>The Iilmaraan grand-mère behind them clears her throat impatiently. </p>
<p>"Monsieur, can you confirm that you saw Detective Du Bois here the night before last?" </p>
<p>"I can," says Marcin, smiling at Harry. </p>
<p>"Do you remember the time?" </p>
<p>"It was late," Marcin says, as if recalling a fond memory. "I was quite lonely, in the shop with Pacha." Kim surmises that Pacha is the cat. "Detective Du Bois came in, looking for some cigarettes. And some company too, it seemed. He stayed a long time to chat."</p>
<p>"What did you talk about?" </p>
<p>"Oh, this and that. The peninsula. The city. Music."</p>
<p>"Around what time did he depart?" </p>
<p>Marcin glances at the clock. "10:30, perhaps?" </p>
<p>Kim checks it off. </p>
<p>"Does that square with what he told you, Lieutenant?" Marcin asks, with a wink at Harry that Kim does not miss. </p>
<p>Kim closes his notebook. "It does. Thank you for your help, Monsieur."</p>
<p>"Yeah, very much appreciated, Marcin," Harry says. </p>
<p>"Anything else I can assist with?" Marcin says, ignoring the growing queue of shoppers behind them. </p>
<p>"Actually," Harry says, leaning on the counter, "There is." </p>
<p><em>Is there? </em>thinks Kim.</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> Of course there is.</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">BRAIN BOUNCER:</span> Dammit.</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="int">DATA COLLECTOR:</span> Noting the lean towards Marcin to solicit the information. Calculated, or instinctive? </p>
<p>"Another guest at the Dacha. Name of Armin Van Mauer. He's a white guy, brown hair, sort of tweedy. Have you seen him around at all?"</p>
<p>"I see everyone in this town, Detective," the shop owner says with a smile. "Especially you out-of-towners. And I make sure I get all of them talking, so I can learn all their secrets."</p>
<p>"Oh, really?"</p>
<p>"Really. And one thing I will tell you, <em>gendarmes</em>—there has been an unusual number of out-of-towners these last months. In the summertime, sure, there are bathers and hikers. But not usually in March. It's a miserable time of year, no? Yet here you are. And you, Lieutenant, and that handsome colonel, and the professor, and now these wealthy Vespertines. And of course, Armin. It's striking. What is it that you all want with this oyster village?"</p>
<p>Harry glances at Kim. </p>
<p>"I came here for the hiking," Kim says blandly.</p>
<p>He glances at Harry, expecting him to give a reason for his visit. But he doesn't.</p>
<p>"What do you think about Armin?" he says instead.</p>
<p>Marcin grimaces. He opens his mouth, looking like he's searching for something nice to say in this very public place.</p>
<p>"He is... what one would call, in my line of work, not a happy customer. What I have, it is not good enough for him. He asks me to order things for him. Fresh fruit, for example. This time of year, we cannot get that kind of thing here. It's underripe or it's bruised by the time it arrives. I tell him, you ought to settle for the cantaloupe and clementines and the canned pineapple. And coffee—ah. He needs real coffee, not powder. Bon, <em>well</em>—" Marcin opens his hands, giving them a significant look. "<em>Pff. </em>We would all like some real café from time to time, but be serious. It's 10 réal for a pound, nobody out here is paying that. Yesterday, the same argument with the man from Vesper." </p>
<p>"Did you have any idea why Armin was in town?" Harry asks. </p>
<p>"Has he left?" </p>
<p>"Uh—" Marcin looks at Harry intently. Harry looks at Kim. Kim looks impassively back at him.</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> Oops.</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="int">INTERPERSONAL ACUITY:</span> (challenging—success) I would like to raise my eyebrows at you in a "What did I tell you?" manner, but for the sake of maintaining a united front, I will refrain. </p>
<p>Harry apparently gets the message. "—Yes, he has." </p>
<p>"I got the sense the two of <em>you</em> spent some quality time together," Marcin says, "Didn't you?"</p>
<p>"A bit," Harry admits, ignoring or missing the implication. "He was always cagey about personal information. All I knew was that he was good at cards. Bit of a shark." </p>
<p>"He's probably counting," Marcin says. "He's an engineer. That means he's got the math skills."</p>
<p>"An engineer?" Kim says. "Do you know what kind?" </p>
<p>Harry glances at him sideways. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> Not investigating, huh?</p>
<p>"I don't, but he was always buying wire and such," Marcin says. "Electrical tape. Radio parts."</p>
<p class="notebook">Engineer? Radio? Bought supplies from Marcin, wire, tape, parts—building? Repairing?</p>
<p>"Are you investigating Armin for some reason, gendarmes?" Marcin asks as Kim writes his notes.</p>
<p>"Thanks, Marcin," Harry says. "We'll stop holding up your line. You've been a huge help—as always."</p>
<p>"Of course," Marcin says. "If you need any more aid, you know where to find me." He flashes another grin. As Harry turns away, he winks at Kim too. Kim gives him his most placid near-smile, like the glass countertop is a bar and the night isn't young enough to be dealing with someone like Harry. </p>
<p>Outside, Harry holds the door for him, brushing the hair out of his face with his other hand—the wind is picking up. The Tervuren is waiting, leash tied to a signpost. </p>
<p>"He's a sweet guy, huh?" Harry says, as Kim kneels down to untie the dog. </p>
<p>"Marcin?" </p>
<p>"Yeah." Harry thumbs his stubbly cheek thoughtfully. "Marcin."</p>
<p>Kim turns back to the knot, not trusting his face. "Mm." </p>
<p>"There's something about him... that doesn't seem to belong here in Valènce. He seems too... cosmopolitan." </p>
<p>Kim closes his eyes and purses his lips where Harry can't see it. </p>
<p>"Cosmopolitan?" </p>
<p>"What?" Harry says, looking down at him like he can see through the back of his head. </p>
<p>"Hm?" Kim manages to say in a fairly neutral tone.</p>
<p>"Is something funny?" </p>
<p>"Nothing, Detective," Kim says, turning to look up at Harry. "He's a nice young man. Perhaps it's his earrings that strike you as... cosmopolitan." </p>
<p>Harry frowns. "Maybe."</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">BRAIN BOUNCER:</span> (formidable—success) Hold it in.</p>
<p>Still lost in thought, Harry twists open his citrus soda. Kim studies him from the ground. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="int">CONCEPTUALIZATION:</span> (hard—failure) Does he really not know? Can amnesia erase... that? </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="fys">VICE:</span> Does he have to rediscover his sexualité, like a second adolescence? </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">VOLTA DO MAR:</span> I'm fairly certain that even after total amnesia, I would still know that I like men. </p>
<p>Above him, Harry tips his head back, swallowing his sugary soda with relish. A sudden, unprofessional series of thoughts flashes through Kim's mind, in the hemisphere that stays divided from work and—usually—stays obligingly shut off during work hours. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="mot">VACATION KIM:</span>  Not exactly work hours right now, though, is it...?</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> I'm certainly not getting paid for this. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">BRAIN BOUNCER:</span> Absolutely not. New topic of conversation, now. </p>
<p>Kim stands up, leash in hand. "Armin never told you he was an engineer?" </p>
<p>Harry shakes his head, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. </p>
<p>"How well did you know each other?" The question on Kim's mind since their first meeting in the Dacha café—whether he and Armin were sleeping together—seems all but answered. </p>
<p>"We played cards together a few nights this week," Harry replies, "but he didn't talk much about himself. You know how people from Graad are. They'll argue politics and philosophy with you even if you're total strangers, but if you ask them about their family, they'll look at you like you're a pervert. I did most of the talking."</p>
<p>"What about politics and philosophy? What did he have to say about those?" </p>
<p>"He seemed like a conservative continental liberal," Harry replies with surprising precision for an amnesiac. It seems that his political consciousness grew back quickly. "Didn't like INSURCOM much. He complained about it a lot."</p>
<p>"What about them?"</p>
<p>"Nothing about its suppression of democracy or its warhawk interventionism," Harry says, with evident disapproval. "It was about the Moralinternational's economic policy. Which, don't get me wrong, I'm no fan, but... Tax brackets aren't high on my list of concerns." </p>
<p>Kim is interested to know what <em>is </em>high on his list of concerns.</p>
<p>"Anything else?" </p>
<p>"Their tech," Harry says, after a pause. "He said all the INSURCOM R&D funding goes to military instead of other stuff. He thought they should put more money into microtechnology, like Seol. Radiocomputers."</p>
<p>"Sounds like something for an engineer to complain about," Kim says. </p>
<p>Harry nods. Then he eyes Kim. </p>
<p>"Sounds like you want to learn more about our victim, huh, Kim?" he says, raising an eyebrow. "What happened to not investigating? Having second thoughts? Thinking about dipping your toe in?"</p>
<p>"Maybe I am," Kim says with a straight face. "After all, why else would I be talking with the prime suspect?" </p>
<p>Harry laughs, taken by surprise. "Ouch," he says when he recovers. "Shall we?" </p>
<p>Kim, smiling faintly, gestures for him to lead on. </p>
<p>They wait for a cart to pass, pulled by a bored-looking mule and pursued by a herd of children on rusty bicycles. They pass the last row of shacks and descend the stairs into the marina. The quay, lined with shacks and shelters, runs over the crest of the shore, and a few more stairs lead down to the piers, fanning out into the bay. It's here that business is done—with difficulty, Kim reads the directory, printed on a yellowed sheet of paper inside a foggy glass case.</p>
<p class="notebook">OYSTER BAY DIRECTORY: Allsalu Refrigeration, Dumas Brothers Oysters, Ifrania Motor Repair, Pinchot Fish Packing, Wild Pines Industrial Supply, Republic Oysters... </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="int">DATA COLLECTOR:</span> Republic Oysters is the factory where those guys work, who gave me a lift yesterday morning. </p>
<p class="notebook">OYSTER BAY DIRECTORY: On the right, there's another printed list—men's names, with boat names and call signs. The boatmen's radio network, same list Claudine had. </p>
<p>While Kim reads the notice board, the Tervuren sniffs a nearby crate on the landing of the staircase. Harry pokes at it with interest. </p>
<p>"This was where you were at 10:30, 11pm?" </p>
<p>Harry nods. </p>
<p>"You think you'll recognize the drunks you spoke with that night?"</p>
<p>"Probably," Harry says. "If they're awake."</p>
<p>Together the three of them walk along the top of the well-worn quay, a brisk sea wind rolling over them. Down on the piers, boats in their berths are getting ready for spring, paint and turpentine buckets open, piles nets laid out on the dock for repair. Scattered throughout it all, men at work—bright smudges of raincoat color against the gray backdrop of wood and sea and sky. Kim regrets bringing tidings of death and oblivion to a place like this. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">VOLTA DO MAR:</span> Death is part of life. All men know this. Especially these men. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="int">CONCEPTUALIZATION:</span> (challenging—success) Not Armin's death. It was unnatural. </p>
<p>Harry Du Bois, Oblivion Cop, steps ahead of Kim to examine some rusty coffee cans. They're full of rusted nails.</p>
<p>"Never know when you might need a rusty nail, I guess," Harry says, and pockets a few. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="int">VRAIMENT VACHOLIERE:</span> And I thought the Jamrock Shuffle was just a joke.</p>
<p>Under a peaked eternite roof, a few old guys are smoking; the smell comes to Kim before their faces come into focus, and he feels a pang of envy in his lungs. </p>
<p>"Expecting rain?" Harry asks, taking the lead. </p>
<p>"Yeah," a few of the old men confirm. "Soon. Next hour or so." </p>
<p>Someone points at clouds too far away for Kim to make out, and says something about their composition. Harry asks a few more questions, and soon, without ever introducing himself, he's charmed his way into a free cigarette. They offer Kim one too, but he declines politely. </p>
<p>They're retired fishermen and oystermen, Samaran and Iilmaraan, with arthritic hands and weather-beaten faces and wooden teeth; one man is missing a leg, another an eye. Harry asks them about the coming season. It was a cold winter, they tell him, but short—miserable in January and February, but an early thaw in March, plenty of rain, little frost. The water will warm up as soon as the sun comes back, and then they'll plant the oysters, and soon, life will begin again. "For now, it's just the waiting."</p>
<p>Harry nods, listening intently. </p>
<p>"Gentlemen, perhaps you could settle a debate between me and my colleague," Harry says, "since we're from out of town. We're about 50 kilometers from Porch Collapse—is that right?"</p>
<p>Mumbling assent. One guy looks at a friend to check his math and then says to Harry, "About 50 southeast, give or take." </p>
<p>"No, it's 80," says another. </p>
<p>"53," says a third guy. "50, plus three kilometers of émergence." </p>
<p>"What about l'émergence?" Harry asks. "Where is the frontière, officially?" </p>
<p>"Three kilometers away," the third guy insists. "Ossette. That's where it starts."</p>
<p>"No, Sal, the whole cape is part of l'émergence." </p>
<p>"Yeah," another agrees.</p>
<p>"No," Sal grumbles. "I've lived here my whole life. None of that weird shit. It doesn't happen here."</p>
<p>His neighbor makes a face. "Weird shit happens all the time, Sal."</p>
<p>"So, you think we are in the zone d'émergence?" Harry asks him. </p>
<p>"I don't know, son. You know who you should talk to—" He gestures with his pipe— "Émile. Émile Savitry."</p>
<p>"Who?"</p>
<p>"Local entroponologist. Took over from old Solmaz last year. Émile's the one who makes the daily reports, and tells us if a palestorm's comin'."</p>
<p>"Solmaz was better," Sal comments. </p>
<p>"Well, he dropped dead, and I'm pretty sure Émile's better than a corpse."</p>
<p>"Where can we find Émile?" Harry asks. </p>
<p>"The station is up on the radio tower, above the campground. That's that-a-ways, north of town." </p>
<p>"Forty years, he manned that tower," Sal says, chewing on his cigar. </p>
<p>When the time is right, Harry signals Kim. He asks the old men if any of them were smoking on the docks two nights ago, around 10 PM. No, they were home in bed. The old drunks are who you're looking for, they say, and they're usually at the pub this time of day. They thank the old fishermen, and climb the stairs back up to the road. </p>
<p>"You think Émile Savitry will back up your Pale exposure theory?"</p>
<p>"My what?" says Harry, distracted.</p>
<p>"Is that why you want to talk to him?" </p>
<p>"Huh? No—I just thought it would be interesting," Harry replies.</p>
<p>Kim watches Harry closely as they approach the pub. <em>Is bringing him into a pub a good idea?</em> Harry is whistling tunelessly, keeping pace with the dog. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="int">INTERPERSONAL ACUITY:</span> (hard—failure) Whistling, indicating that he's relaxed? </p>
<p>They're in luck—a red sign in the pub window reads CLOSED. Their contacts are not in the pub, they're waiting outside. In the stubby yellow grass, an Ubi man and a Samara man slouch, each holding a tall, narrow brown paper bag in their hands. The Samaran guy appears to be asleep.</p>
<p>"Do you think they'll remember you?" Kim asks, seriously.</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> Guys like this have a tendency to tell me things about myself that I don't remember, Harry thinks. </p>
<p>"I hope not," Harry says. </p>
<p>"Excuse me," Kim says to them, taking the lead. The Ubi guy hastily sits up straighter against the outer wall of the pub, and covers his brown paper bag. He looks around 65 or 70, though it's hard to really say—he could be 50 or even younger. What little hair remains is white, and his stubble is still a little auburn. His coat is heavy, sheepskin with fleece lining, caked in mud in places, but sturdy, and Kim wonders where and when he got it, and how many times it's saved him from hypothermia. His friend is not so lucky, bundled up in so many layers that his back barely slouches as he sleeps. Kim unclips the dog and lets her roam off—big dogs tend to make guys like this nervous. </p>
<p>"Spare a few centimes?" says Sheepskin Jacket. "We're fundraising, Benoît and I—gonna buy ourselves a boat."</p>
<p>"What kind?" Harry asks. </p>
<p>"Sailboat," replies Sheepskin Jacket. "Gonna get out of this place. But first we—" He pauses to suppress a belch— "First we need a boat."</p>
<p>"Why not a motor boat?" Harry asks. "It would be faster. And probably cheaper."</p>
<p>Sheepskin shakes his head, eyes still closed. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="int">DATA COLLECTOR</span> (medium—success): Fighting down nausea. </p>
<p>"Save on gas," he manages. </p>
<p>"Are you both going?" </p>
<p>"'Course," he says. "He's my ticket out of here. Used to be a champion sailboat racer, Benoît. Isn't that right, Benny?" He shakes Benoît by the arm. Benoît grunts, frowning with his eyes closed. </p>
<p>"Not a racer, just a sailor," Benoît mumbles. "It was a fishing boat. Idiot." </p>
<p>Sheepskin smiles weakly up at them. "What do you say? Care to invest?" </p>
<p>Kim, who has been watching Harry through this conversation, reaches wordlessly into his pants pocket and collects all the coins there. He holds them out to Sheepskin, who reaches up to take them eagerly. "Thank you, sir," he says. </p>
<p>"I'm Detective Kitsuragi with the RCM," Kim says. "Revachol Citizens Militia."</p>
<p>Sheepskin squints, like he's trying to summon some geographical information. "Revachol?" </p>
<p>"I'm here investigating a murder," Kim says. The simplest version of the truth seems like the most expedient strategy. "It took place a few nights ago, in Ifrania-du-roi. I wonder if you gentlemen were out at the docks around 11 PM?" </p>
<p>Benoît has opened one eye and is squinting through it at Kim. "We usually are. When was this?" </p>
<p>"Two nights ago." </p>
<p>Sheepskin does a little mental math. "Was it raining?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Then, yes," he says. </p>
<p>"Do you remember seeing this gentleman?" Kim gestures at Harry.</p>
<p>The two drunks turn their bleary eyes on Harry. </p>
<p>"Sure," says Benoît. "Harrier." </p>
<p>Harry doesn't confirm or deny.</p>
<p>"Can you tell me about that?" Kim asks.</p>
<p>"Sure. Harry came shuffling down the stairs to the quay. We were having a smoke and a drink. He joined us."</p>
<p>"What did you talk about?" </p>
<p>"Pff, I don't know." </p>
<p>"He told us he was a cop," offers Sheepskin. </p>
<p>"A super corrupt cop," Benoît adds. "Drugs, bribes, the whole deal. Said he wouldn't bust us for public intoxication if we shared. So what else could we do? We gave him the rest of the Commodore." </p>
<p>"That's not true," Harry says immediately. He looks at Kim. "That's not what happened."</p>
<p>Benoît grins. "He drank it all and smashed the bottle on the rocks. Then he asked us where he could get more, since Marcin wouldn't sell him—sell him any more liquor." </p>
<p>"Kim," Harry says.</p>
<p>Benoît is laughing now, a wheezy, asthmatic sound that sounds like it should be coming from a much older man. His friend laughs too, just because Benoît's laughing. "No. He told us he lost all his memories, and then quit the drink. So he left. Thought he was better than us." </p>
<p>"I never said anything like that," Harry says. </p>
<p>"You do think you're better than us. Well, you're not. You'll be back in there in no time, pig," he says, knocking on the wood of the pub wall behind him. "It'll be like you never left. And we'll be waiting to welcome you back with <em>open</em> arms." Benoît punctuates his point by spitting on the ground next to him. Then he takes a deep drink from his brown paper bag. </p>
<p>"Come on," Kim says. When Harry doesn't move, he tugs the fabric of his sleeve. Sheepskin also takes a drink, then smiles up at Harry again, still lost. </p>
<p>"Anything else, officer?" Sheepskin says to Kim. </p>
<p>"That's all, thank you," Kim says. "Harrier. Let's go." </p>
<p>Still, the detective doesn't move. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> He's mad. Really mad. Angry enough to puke or kick the guy in the head. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">VOLTA DO MAR:</span> Or to take his advice and have a drink?</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">COMPASSION:</span> Please, tell me he's not the kind of cop who kicks the shit out of homeless drunks. </p>
<p>"Detective," Kim says sharply. "Walk away." </p>
<p>That gets results. Harrier tears his eyes away from Benoît and looks sideways at Kim. Kim jerks his head and leads him away, to where the Tervueren is snuffling under some evergreen shrubs. Kim whistles at her, and she reluctantly abandons her investigation. Kim clicks his tongue and she falls in beside them. </p>
<p>"What happened back there, Detective?" Kim asks, after a few moments of silent walking.</p>
<p>"I shouldn't have let him get under my skin. Sorry. I'm an idiot." </p>
<p>"You don't need to concern yourself with what others think about you," Kim says, ignoring the self-critique. "What they think is none of your business. Especially a stranger." </p>
<p>"But I—" Harry breaks off. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="fys">SHIVERS:</span> ...What if he's right about me? </p>
<p>"You're much better off than they are," Kim says, eliding the question of Harry's True Nature. "Remember that. When you look at them, remind yourself that you are on a better path, now." </p>
<p>Harry mhms quietly. </p>
<p>"At least they have each other," Harry says wryly, after another moment. They're out of the town center now, walking past a junkyard of abandoned boats, tractors, and horse carts. </p>
<p>"Do you have a partner?" Kim asks, a theory forming. </p>
<p>Harry shrugs. </p>
<p>"You don't know?"</p>
<p>"No, I don't. I did, but..." Harry kicks a rock, and then taps his temple with two fingers. "After this, he dropped me. Or rather, tried to. The paperwork's in process right now." </p>
<p>"So when you get back, will you get a new partner?"</p>
<p>Harry shrugs again. "I don't think there's anyone left at the 41st who wants to work with me."</p>
<p>"The RCM operates on a décomptage system, Detective. We can't do fieldwork without a partner."</p>
<p>"Then maybe I'll quit." </p>
<p>"All right," Kim says. "Do you want to walk her?" He holds up the leash, currently in the rare state of not being tugged by the Tervueren. </p>
<p>Harry takes it. "Hey, girl," he says, as she glances back to see what's going on. "You do any tricks?" She resumes pulling forward, panting. Harry prompts Kim— "Any tricks?" </p>
<p>"Of a kind," Kim says. </p>
<p>"Did you teach her?"</p>
<p>"No," Kim says. </p>
<p>"How did she learn them?"</p>
<p>"She's very intelligent," Kim says, facing front. "When do you go back to work, Detective?"</p>
<p>"Not sure," Harry says gloomily. "I'm on administrative leave, of the Get-The-Hell-Out-Of-My-Sight variety." </p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>Harry taps the side of his head again. "Because of the epic bender that led to this shitshow. And the shitshow that followed, which I fucked up. Bad. Bunch of bad people are looking for me now. They probably want to kill me almost half as badly as my captain and my partner do." </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> Based on my knowledge of Captain Ptolomey Price—that sounds about right. </p>
<p>"What's your partner's name?"</p>
<p>"Jean Vicquemare," Harry says. </p>
<p>Kim didn't recognize the name. "How long have you worked together?"</p>
<p>"Two years, apparently."</p>
<p>"You don't remember him?"</p>
<p>"Nope."</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="int">INTERPERSONAL ACUITY:</span> Officer Vicquemare probably doesn't like that.</p>
<p>Harry seems to be struggling to articulate something else. "He—it seems like we worked together pretty well, for a while. We ran a homicide task force together. But I ran that into the ground. Now our décomptage is full of holes and sinking fast. The captain's probably dismantling it and reassigning everyone as we speak."</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> Price will probably put him on indefinite desk duty when he gets home. </p>
<p>"I see."</p>
<p>"What about you, Kim? You got a partner?" </p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Bernadette, she's your partner?" Harry smiles over at him, trying to get him to smile. Kim forces his mouth to accommodate itself into a curve.</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="int"> INTERPERSONAL ACUITY</span>  (hard—success): Participating in the joke means you're in a good mood, which means that nothing is wrong. </p>
<p>"That's right," Kim says. </p>
<p>Bernadette barks. </p>
<p>It's her warning bark. Kim looks up, and sees what she does—a bay horse and a white llama, trotting down the road in their direction. Another horse, further up the road, is examining a wooden fence. </p>
<p>The animals pass them by, and the straggler horse starts nibbling on the wood plank. </p>
<p>"We must be near Henri's school," Harry says. </p>
<p>"Ah. Of course," Kim says. As they get near the horse, Harry moves the leash to his left hand so he can slap the horse's rump. </p>
<p>"Hey!" he says, and the horse rears its head, snorting in offense. "Stop cribbing." </p>
<p>The horse tosses its mane and trots off after its comrades. </p>
<p>"Bad for their teeth," Harry explains. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="mot">TORQUE DORK:</span><strong> </strong>Sugar, I avoid any and all means of transport with its own opinions and internal organs, so I would not know anything about that. </p>
<p>Kim nods. </p>
<p>True to Henri's report, the next thing they see is a harried woman running down the road after the livestock. "They went that way!" Harry says, and she waves him off without answering. The school is around the corner, hidden behind the junkyard crane. It's brick, and actually looks like it's in reasonably good repair, but the windows are all dark on the upper floors, and boarded up on the lower floor. Chickens are pecking around the playground. Instinctively, Harry and Kim both drift closer. </p>

<p>"Where do tenth graders go?" Harry wonders aloud. The Tervueren whines at the chain link fence, longing to go in and terrorize the chickens. </p>
<p>"Regional school?" Kim suggests, doing the same math. That's where Henri ought to go, next fall. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="int">VRAIMENT VACHOLIERE:</span> Most kids from Revachol are lucky to make it to tenth grade. The secondary graduation rate in Revachol West is something like 45%. Kim dropped out. He went back, later.</p>

<p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> Whose budget, then? Or rather, whose pockets? </p>
<p>"Very illegal," Harry says again. "We should find out what the real story is, here. I know it's not our jurisdiction, or our business, but..."</p>
<p>"No, you're right," Kim says. "Someone is getting away with something." </p>
<p>"Harry!" </p>
<p>The call comes from around the corner of the schoolyard, and they both look up. A white-haired man is waving to them, approaching. </p>
<p>"Howdy, Colonel," Harry says, waving back. </p>
<p>When the man gets close enough to see, it's obvious from his bearing and his haircut; instinctively, Kim's spine straightens and his shoulders go flat. He recognizes him from the Dacha—an older Graadian man, well-groomed, and neatly though not expensively dressed, with the straight, white teeth of a Coalition national. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="int">DATA COLLECTOR:</span> This must be the 'handsome colonel' that Marcin was talking about. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="fys">VICE:</span> Is he?</p>
<p>"Kim, this is the colonel. He's staying at the Dacha, too."</p>
<p>"Good afternoon, sir."</p>
<p>"Colonel Valentin Axel Malmström, retired." </p>
<p>"And, Colonel, this is Lieutenant Kitsuragi of the 57th precinct."</p>
<p>They shake hands firmly. </p>
<p>"Ah, a colleague?" the colonel says. "This is good. So you two are looking into the case?" </p>
<p>"Euh... Not exactly, no," Kim says, clasping his hands behind his back. Parade rest. The Tervueren keeps watch on the chickens with a slowly wagging tail. </p>
<p>"I think you should," Colonel Malmström says gravely. He looks to Harry. "Harry, this is serious. The disappearance of a foreign national, in a town of this size—they've no resources to address it. Once word gets to INSURCOM, they'll send someone just like you. It's a <em>good </em>thing you're already here."</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="int">DATA COLLECTOR:</span> How does he know that Armin's missing, but not dead? </p>
<p>"We are interested in altering INSURCOM," Kim says, before Harry can answer. "Any guidance you could give us on that front would be most helpful." </p>
<p>"The radio tower," Malmström says promptly, gesturing back the way he came. "There's a problem with the transmitter. The fellow in there, Camrose, says he can fix it, but it's been days. If he can't fix it soon, I'll have to leave town and alert the authorities myself."</p>
<p>"Are you here in an official capacity, Colonel?" Kim asks.</p>
<p>"No, no," he says. "I'm recently retired. A <em>well</em>-earned retirement," he adds. "But I still have my duty to my countryman. If Armin Van Mauer doesn't turn up soon, I will send for aid." </p>
<p>Kim looks over at Harry—<em>Do we tell him?</em></p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> No.</p>
<p>"Do you know each other?" Kim asks.</p>
<p>"Only as of this month. We've been staying at the Dacha. Not the friendliest fellow," the Colonel adds. "But yes, we spoke. He told me about his upbringing, his work. I suppose you want to know all you can?"</p>
<p>He raises his eyebrows expectantly. Kim's hand, reflexive in obedience, moves towards his pocket for his notebook before he stops it. </p>
<p>"Not yet," Harry says, finally making a play. "We're trying to get an idea of his movements the day before his disappearance. Do you remember seeing Armin in the Dacha two nights ago?"</p>
<p>The Colonel thinks deeply about it. "At dinner," he finally says. "I saw him with you. You were playing cards." </p>
<p>Harry nods. The Tervueren tears herself away from the forbidden chickens and makes a friendly advance on the Colonel's khaki knees. He obligingly scratches her head. </p>
<p>"You didn't speak to him that evening?" Kim asks. </p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"That was the only time you saw him?" </p>
<p>"Correct. I had an early night."</p>
<p>"And what about the next morning?" Kim asks mildly. This is the most crucial hour of Harry's alibi, as it stands.</p>
<p>"Next morning, next morning... No, come to think of it, he wasn't at breakfast."</p>
<p>"Did you have breakfast with anybody?" Kim asks.</p>
<p>A pause. "Harry, I had breakfast with you, didn't I?" </p>
<p>"Yes, as I recall, you did." </p>
<p>The Colonel nods to Kim. "Breakfast with Harry. No sign of Armin. Does that help you?" </p>
<p>"It confirms what we knew," Kim says. </p>
<p>"Whom else have you spoken with?" he asks, looking to Harry.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid we can't say, yet, sir," Harry replies with aplomb. </p>
<p>"Of course, of course. Well, do keep me abreast. I hope your search is successful, and Armin is returned to us safely, soon." </p>
<p>"I didn't know they were friendly," Harry comments, after Valentin leaves. </p>
<p>"Was Armin really 'friendly' with anyone?" Kim asks, filling in the checkmarks on his chart. </p>
<p>Harry makes an 'mm' sound. </p>
<p>"So, how are you liking the shape of my alibi?"</p>
<p>"I like it, Detective," Kim says. "I like it very much, except for the big doughnut hole in the middle." </p>
<p>Kim hands him the notebook.</p>

<p>"The doughnut hole in question is... this?" Harry puts his finger on 4-6 AM. </p>
<p>"Yes. We're also still missing Alexei," Kim adds. "We need to interview him this evening, when he returns to the hostel." </p>
<p>Harry nods, eyes distant, following the chickens moving behind Kim.</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="int">DATA COLLECTOR:</span> He's drifting. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="fys">VICE:</span> Probably overdue for another infusion of sugar. </p>
<p>"We can talk about it after lunch," Kim says. His stomach is growling—it's long past noon. "Come on, Detective. Good work today. We made good progress." </p>
<p>Harry falls into step beside him, and the Tervueren orbits them as they turn and walk back towards the Dacha.  </p>
<p>"So, how old is she?" Harry asks. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="int">INTERPERSONAL ACUITY:</span> He really won't stop. </p>
<p>"She's three." </p>
<p>"Where did you get her?" </p>
<p>"The usual place, Detective," Kim lies, keeping his face neutral. </p>
<p>"What tricks can she do?" </p>
<p>"The usual tricks."</p>
<p>"Kim?"</p>
<p>"...Yes?" </p>
<p>"I have a theory."</p>
<p>Dread. "A theory about the case?" </p>
<p>"A theory about you," Harrier says. <em>Great. </em>"I think you're trying to convince me that you're boring." </p>
<p>Not what Kim was expecting. He glances sideways at Harry. "I assure you, Detective, I am not trying. You will not need convincing to come to that conclusion." </p>
<p>"I think I might need some convincing," Harry replies doggedly. "You seem pretty cool to me." He takes out Marcin's pack of cigarettes and holds it out to Kim. Kim gestures no-thank-you. "Boring people don't go around wearing black leather motorcycle jackets." </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="mot">KINETIC DRESSAGE:</span> Damn right. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="fys">KIM'S EMOTIONS:</span> Aw. He thinks I'm cool. How flattering.</p>

<p class="skill"><span class="psy">BRAIN BOUNCER:</span> Correct. Do not.</p>
<p>"I'll keep working on it, then," Kim says, watching Harry light up. He puts his forefinger and thumb in his mouth and whistles twice, summoning the dog into closer orbit. </p>
<p>"She's very obedient," Harry comments. <em>She really is not, </em>Kim thinks. "Why Bernadette?"</p>
<p>"It's a pretty name."</p>
<p>"When she was—"</p>
<p>"Detective." Kim stops walking. Harry, surprised, stops too. "Enough questions about the dog, all right? I want you to stop. Understood?" </p>
<p>"Oh," Harry says. "Okay. I'm sorry." </p>
<p>"Okay." Kim, his mouth a flat line, looks up at Harry's face—the cigarette hangs out of his slightly open mouth. Gauging.  </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">VOLTA DO MAR:</span> He'll listen. </p>
<p>Kim shoves his hands into his pockets and they turn to keep walking. </p>
<p>They follow the road back into town, and buy sandwiches at the diner, The Pole Star. It's past 3, and deserted, with one waitress and plastic tables as flimsy as lawn furniture. The rain starts as they sit inside, in a wooden booth that feels more like a pew. Kim reopens his notebook to the alibi chart. Harry, stirring a week's worth of coffee into his sugar, cranes his neck to see. </p>
<p>"So, what can we do about the doughnut hole?" </p>
<p>"Well," Kim says, "If what you say is true—you were in your room, alone, at the time when the murder probably took place, then there are two options. First, we can speak with the patrons in the surrounding rooms, and see if they remember hearing you come in and out. The other option is—narrow the window of Armin's time of death. If we can somehow prove that he was killed after 6 AM, you'll become a very unlikely suspect."</p>
<p>Kim flips back in his notebook, looking for yesterday's crime scene notes from Ossette Gorge. </p>
<p>"As it stands, you make very little sense as a suspect—unless you had an accomplice. Look at this." Kim shows him his notes on the footprints. "Armin's body was deposited here at 11 AM. Low tide. I was there. You were not. You were on a beach on the other side of the cape. Many witnesses put you there. So, the only scenario in which you could be guilty, Harry, is one in which you not only committed a murder you can't remember, but you also have an accomplice that you've forgotten about." </p>
<p>Harry reads the notes, slowly nodding. He seems to study every word. Then he flips to the next page, and reads that too. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> Can he read my handwriting? </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT (MALIN) DE CORPS:</span> That's what's taking him so long. Deciphering it. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">BRAIN BOUNCER:</span> Showing this to him is not really the behavior of someone who is "not investigating." </p>
<p>Kim leans back against the bench, slowly eating his frites while Harry reads. He lets Harry read all the notes, page by page, without disturbing him. As Harry concentrates, he puts his foot up on the bench and hugs his knee, like a kid lost in a good book. </p>
<p>Once he finishes, he slides the notebook back to Kim. "To narrow the window of Armin's time of death... What are our options?" </p>
<p>"One, field autopsy," Kim says. "That is not really an option at this point. His body is gone. Lost at sea. Two, find the site of the murder—the scene of the crime. If it's close to the Dacha, that doesn't help you. But if it's far, that narrows the window." </p>
<p>"Travel time," Harry murmurs. He sips some of his lukewarm coffee, looking outside at the street. Under the awning, shielded from the rain, the Tervueren sleeps with her dark fur pressed up against the window. </p>
<p>"Our best option for that," Kim says, after a pause, "is to alert the authorities. The sooner they begin their investigation, the sooner you'll be cleared."</p>
<p>"What authorities, exactly?" Harry says. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> This is the sticking point, isn't it?</p>
<p>"MIBE," Kim says, with a sigh. Moralist International Border Enforcement. Most cops pronounce it like a word, '<em>mibe</em>.' "I don't like it, either, but as Malmström said, Armin is a foreign national. If Graad starts to make a stink about it, they'll want to be involved." </p>
<p>Harry is adding a flavored creamer of some kind to his coffee—mace and nutmeg. He deposits the wrapper and then adds another flavored creamer—currant. He stirs them with his knife, looking up at Kim, who tears his eyes away from the culinary misconduct—"Tell me... Hypothetically, if this was our jurisdiction, then hypothetically, would MIBE have precedence?" Harry asks.</p>
<p>"You mean, if Armin was killed in, say, Jamrock, would their jurisdiction supersede ours?" Harry nods. "No," Kim says. "Though legally, they could choose to take over the investigation at any point, if they wanted to. But that's actually true of any case the RCM investigates. We have very little in the way of actual legal power." </p>
<p>"I'm sorry for taking up a whole day of your vacation," Harry says after a pause where they both watch the rain.</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="mot">VACATION KIM:</span> You should be.</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">BRAIN BOUNCER:</span> Be quiet, Vacation Kim. </p>
<p>"It's all right, Detective." </p>
<p>They wait for the rain to subside in silence, in the deserted diner. Kim has his book, which he reads in his lap so Harry can't see the cover; Harry plays Patience with his deck of cards. The sun sinks behind the clouds. The buildings outside, wooden shacks dark with rain and whitewashed military walls dark with dust, turn from gray to black, details fading into nothingness. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">VOLTA DO MAR</span> (easy—failure): This is the hardest time of day for you, lately. You don't know why, though you try to rationalize it. That hasn't made it any better. Something about the sun's premature departure makes a hole in your chest, and it feels as though everything else is being sucked into that hole—the past, the present, the future. That sucking, pulling sensation stretches the fibers of your being, bends your ribs inward, puts a pressure on your lungs that doesn't go away until dinner time, and sometimes not even then. Sometimes it persists until you sleep. Those nights, you go to bed early—to escape it. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS</span> (easy—success): Having company makes it more bearable. </p>
<p>"What were you reading?" Harry asks as they depart the diner. Hiding his reluctance, Kim flashes the cover. </p>
<p>High Speed Love: the Tragic True Love Story of Jacob Irw and Alfie Deletraz, by Cecilia Averbrook.</p>
<p>"Neat," Harry says, reading it. "I like TipTop. I think." </p>
<p>"Do you?" Kim says, hiding the book inside his leather jacket.</p>
<p>"Yeah, racing is awesome," Harry says, buttoning up his blazer. "And Jacob Irw is the GOAT,"</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="int">DATA COLLECTOR:</span> No comment about his homo-sexualité? </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="int">INTERPERSONAL ACUITY:</span> He probably didn't notice that Alfie is a man's name. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="mot">KINETIC DRESSAGE:</span> It's not the homo-sexualité that is embarrassing. It's the tabloid nature of the book. It's trashy. I don't read trashy books.</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="mot">VACATION KIM:</span> Yeah, but I do! </p>
<p>Face neutral and ears burning, Kim holds the door open for Harry. Outside, he is dismayed to discover that the Tervueren has chewed partway through her leash. They return to the Dacha through the cold, hissing rain. </p>
<h3>*</h3>
<h3>*</h3>
<p>Back at the hostel, Kim returns the dog to Henri's custody and then they make a circuit of the Dacha's halls and common areas, looking for Alexei the Anthropologist. He is nowhere to be found. So, they ask Claudine for his room number. 16. Ground floor, facing the driveway. Harry knocks.</p>
<p>"Last one," Kim murmurs, as a chair moves and shoes thump behind the door. There's a long pause. Then the door opens a sliver, and one bespectacled eye looks out. </p>
<p>"Hello?" </p>
<p>"Professor Volya," Kim says, taking the lead. "We met yesterday."</p>
<p>"Hi, officer. Is something wrong?"</p>
<p>"My associate and I have some questions for you regarding the call you made last night—to the Constable. Could we speak with you?" </p>
<p>The eye of Ali the Anthropologist thinks about it. "Um... I'm fine with speaking with you, but wasn't he, um, locked up?"</p>
<p>"Detective Du Bois?"</p>
<p>"Yes?" Ali's eye looks from one to the other, through the gap in his doorway. </p>
<p>"Locked up for what?" Harry inquires, friendly and loud.</p>
<p>"Disturbing the... peace?"</p>
<p>"Consider the peace restored," Harry says, smiling widely. "I'm out." </p>
<p>Ali's eye looks at Kim. </p>
<p>"Professor Volya, Detective Du Bois can wait outside, if that makes you feel more at ease." </p>
<p>"Okay," Ali says. "You can come in, but you—you stay there, Detective. And—I'll leave the door open so you can listen."</p>
<p>"Fine by me," says Harry. </p>
<p>Ali opens up the rest of the way and lets Kim in. Kim and Harry share a parting glance as the door pulls shut behind him. Ali locks the chain lock, leaving the door just ajar. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="fys">VICE:</span> (challenging—failure) A strange frisson shivers through you as you enter this man's room—like he's brought you back here from the bar.

<p class="skill"><span class="int">DATA COLLECTOR:</span> There's definitely a lot of... other clues. Remember how he said he'd been here for the last two months?

<p class="skill"><span class="int">DATA COLLECTOR:</span> Nope.</p>
<p>Rain patters on the panes. Alexei gets flustered about where Kim should sit, since every available chair is covered in books and stacks of paper. Finally, he transfers a sheaf of folders from the ugly '30s-style couch to the bed and Kim sits, sinking onto the uncomfortable wooden frame. Alexei rolls his heavy desk chair over and sinks down on it with a creak of rusted springs. </p>
<p>"What can I help you with?" Ali the Anthropologist sits on his hands, then pulls them out and clasps them in his lap. </p>
<p>Kim flips open his notebook and adjusts his glasses. "I'm assisting the Constable in the disappearance of Armin Van Mauer," he says. "I'm hoping you can tell me more about the argument you overheard two nights ago."</p>
<p>"Oh. Right, right... Uh." Ali glances back over at the cracked door. A sliver of yellow light with a Harry-shaped obstruction. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> Quite aware this counts as witness intimidation, yes.</p>
<p>"You have no retribution to fear from Detective Du Bois," Kim says after a healthy pause. "These inquiries are completely unofficial. We're just assisting the local authorities, as I said." </p>
<p>"One of the suspects is assisting the local authorities?" Ali says, in an undertone. </p>
<p>"Suspects?" </p>
<p>Ali's hands twist in his lap. "I—euh—assumed. Because of the fight—"</p>
<p>"Why don't you tell me about the fight, Professor?" </p>
<p>"Uh—" Ali laughs nervously. "I'm not a professor. Just Mr. Volya. I teach <em>au lycée</em> in the city." </p>
<p>"Oh. Excuse me," Kim says. “I was under the impression you were from this area.”</p>
<p>“I am,” Ali says, still sounding chagrined. “I grew up in Ifrania. I left and moved to the city in the early ‘20s, to seek my fortune. Needless to say, it didn’t work out that way... Now I teach history and do research on my own time.”</p>
<p>“And that’s what this trip is for?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” he says. “Government research grant.”</p>
<p>“What government body?” Kim asks mildly. “I don’t think I know of any domestic Revacholian cultural funding.”</p>
<p>“It’s not domestic,” Ali clarifies. “It’s sponsored by MISCO. The Six Soleils used to be a heritage site, did you know? It’s fallen into disrepair. The M.I. is sponsoring a survey of the area for potential restoration. Of course, I have my own, less tourism-centric interests.” He indicates the walls around him.</p>
<p>"Do you hope to publish your findings?" Kim says.</p>
<p>"Yes," Ali says, nodding eagerly. "Yes, I'm working on a manuscript right now." He points to his desk, where a green typewriter is bathed in warm lamplight. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="mot">TORQUE DORK:</span> I'm no expert on typewriters, darling, but that looks pretty fancy, doesn't it? High-tech. Seolite manufacture, mayhaps? </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="int">DATA COLLECTOR:</span> Is that an antenna on the side?</p>
<p>"Is that an antenna on the side of your machine?" </p>
<p>"Yes!" he says. "It has a built-in wireless so you can listen to the radio while you work. Isn't that ingenious?"</p>
<p>"Very," Kim says, nodding. He taps his notebook. "So, the other night—?"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," Ali says, uncomfortably. "What would you like to know?"</p>
<p>"What were you doing when you heard the disturbance?" </p>
<p>"I woke up late in the night... I was having trouble sleeping. It must have been around 3 AM—I have terrible insomnia this time of year. So eventually, I got up, and started working at my desk." He jerks his head towards it. "The clack-clack-zing must drive my neighbors crazy. All hours. I should really apologize to them."</p>
<p>"And this was around the time you heard voices outside?"</p>
<p>"Yes—yes. Just talking, at first. Then they started getting louder. I could tell they were mad about something, but I hadn't really been listening. When they didn't stop, I went over to the window. I was going to—you know—knock on the glass. Tell them to take it somewhere else." </p>
<p>"Did this argument sound serious?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Ali said. "Very serious, actually. I got worried about Armin. The other man was much larger than him, and he seemed to be threatening him. I think he was drunk."</p>
<p>"You identified that man as Harry Du Bois, is that right?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"You know the detective?"</p>
<p>"Only by face," Ali says. "I've seen him around the hostel for the last week or so."</p>
<p>"You've never spoken to him before?"</p>
<p>Ali shakes his head.</p>
<p>"And what about Armin? You knew him?"</p>
<p>Ali nods. He closes his eyes. "We'd spoken, yes." </p>
<p>"Often?"</p>
<p>Ali nods his head. Eyes still closed.</p>
<p>Kim hesitates in his writing.</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="int">INTERPERSONAL ACUITY:</span> (easy—success) He's upset.</p>
<p>"Is something wrong, Mr. Volya?" </p>
<p>Alexei shakes his head, eyes still closed. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="int">INTERPERSONAL ACUITY:</span> (easy—failure) Oh. Maybe everything's fine?</p>
<p>"Are you quite sure?"</p>
<p>He's clearly holding back tears. </p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>From his pocket, Kim pulls a crumpled handkerchief and smooths it out. "Alexei."</p>
<p>"Mhm?"</p>
<p>Slowly, Kim leans over and puts the handkerchief into the crease of his clenched fist. At moments like this, he has found it's best not to say anything.</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="int">LOGIC:</span> (challenging—success) He obviously spoke to Armin more than a few times. And now he's worried about him. He should be. </p>
<p>"We—we knew each other when we were kids."</p>
<p><em>Oh. </em>"You're worried about your friend." </p>
<p>Alexei nods, gripping the handkerchief, but not using it. </p>
<p>"I just—hope—nothing bad happened to him," Alexei squeaks out, "because—of me." </p>
<p>"Because of you?"</p>
<p>"Because I didn't—help him."</p>
<p>"Help him, how?" </p>
<p>Ali shakes his head fast, lip trembling. He covers his mouth with the fist holding the handkerchief. </p>
<p class="notebook">GRONKY, RCM COUNSELOR-IN-TRAINING: "Despite what our parents or guardians might have taught us, it's much better for people to let things <em>out </em>then bottle them <em>up. </em>Especially when it comes to <em>grief.</em>"</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> Not in my experience. But I have found that letting witnesses have a good cry is an expedient interview strategy. </p>
<p>"It's all right."</p>
<p>Ali sniffs loudly. </p>
<p>"I didn't intervene in the fight because—he's always getting into fights with people—and I—I was tired of getting him out... but if I had—" Ali cuts himself off, closing his eyes. </p>
<p>"If he is in danger... or hurt... That isn't your fault. His life is not your responsibility. There's nothing you could have done to prevent it." </p>
<p>Kim is keenly aware of Harry's presence outside. It makes him feel watched. </p>
<p>"I know—I know. But what if I could have—" </p>
<p>At this point, Ali finally lets out a sob and moves his glasses aside so he can wipe his eyes. One sob turns into several more. He covers his face completely with both fists and the handkerchief, trying to hide both his eyes and his mouth; Kim looks away, embarrassed and glad Ali can't see him. </p>
<p>"Ali," Kim says, after the sobs die down. "I can assure you—Detective Du Bois didn't do anything to hurt Armin."</p>
<p>Ali sniffs, still hiding his eyes. "Really?" </p>
<p>"I've spent the day verifying his alibi myself."</p>
<p>"But—"</p>
<p>"The best thing you can do for your friend now is tell me what you remember." </p>
<p>Ali nods stiffly.</p>
<p>“How old were you when you first met?”</p>
<p>“7,” Ali says, studying the handkerchief in his lap. “His family moved here for a few years during the Coalition occupation. He was a military brat. His father was stationed on the base—up at the port—and he and his mother and sister lived in Ifrania. We went to school together.”</p>
<p>“Were you friends?”</p>
<p>Ali gives a one-shouldered shrug, then nods.</p>
<p>“Yes. When we were young.”</p>
<p>“Until?”</p>
<p>“Until they moved away when we were... euh... 14. We didn't really keep in touch. There wasn't really any easy way to keep in touch, back then." He looks up at Kim, saying, <em>Remember? </em>with his eyes. </p>
<p>“So when you saw each other in February…”</p>
<p>“Coincidence,” Ali says miserably, looking at the rug. “I couldn’t believe he was back here again, in this… backwater.”</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">VOLTA DO MAR:</span> (challenging—success) It’s <em>himself</em> that Ali can’t imagine back in this backwater. He's refashioned himself into a city boy over the last thirty years. He doesn’t want to be back in this town. And he didn’t want Armin, world traveler and engineer, to see him back here. Still stagnant. Still stuck. </p>
<p>“Why was he here in Ifrania?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“He never told you?” Kim probes.</p>
<p>Ali shakes his head, staring at the floor.</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">COMPASSION:</span> Does he wish he had?</p>
<p>"So did you two spend much time together yesterday?"</p>
<p>"Yesterday?" Ali's eyes glaze over again. He thinks, or perhaps doesn't. It looks like his mind is going blank. "Yesterday, no... Or the day before."</p>
<p>"You said Armin was prone to getting into fights," Kim says. "This happened often?"</p>
<p>Ali nods miserably. "Too often." </p>
<p>"Do you know what it was they were fighting about that night?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. They sounded drunk." </p>
<p>"But they were close to your window. You must have heard something."</p>
<p>Ali shrugs. "I think it was about a woman."</p>
<p>"Did that surprise you?"</p>
<p>Ali wipes his nose and adjusts his glasses in front of his red-rimmed eyes. "What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Just what I said."</p>
<p>"I—no. Men—fight about that all the time, right?"</p>
<p><em>Harry, though? </em></p>
<p class="skill"><span class="int">DATA COLLECTOR:</span> Maybe he's omnifutuent?</p>
<p>"Why do you think it was about a woman?"</p>
<p>"There was a bit of—she said this, she said that, type of stuff," said Ali. "Sorry—I'm sorry I can't be more help." </p>
<p>"Claudine says she thought it came to blows. Did you see that?"</p>
<p>"I thought it was about to get violent. That was when I ran for help." </p>
<p>"So you went to the front desk?"</p>
<p>"Yes, and Claudine was already there. She called the Constable."</p>
<p>"Where did you go next?"</p>
<p>"Back to my room."</p>
<p>"You didn't wait to see if you friend was all right?"</p>
<p>Ali's face flushes a little at that. "No."</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="int">INTERPERSONAL ACUITY:</span> (medium—success) He was pissed at his friend.</p>
<p>"Because you were angry with him?"</p>
<p>Ali says nothing.</p>
<p>“What happened next?”</p>
<p>"After that, the Constable came to interview me."</p>
<p>"And you didn't see Armin again after that?"</p>
<p>"No." </p>
<p>Kim flips a page on his notebook, and smooths the new page out, more to punctuate a point in the conversation than to make any notes. </p>
<p>"Alexei, I know this might sound like an unfair question, but I want you to really think about it, all right?" </p>
<p>Alexei stares at him. "Okay," he says. </p>
<p>"Are you 100% certain that the men you overheard fighting were Armin Van Mauer and Harry Du Bois? You saw their faces? You would swear to it in court?" </p>
<p>"I..."</p>
<p>"Remember that it may come to that. Your honesty up front—especially about your memory—is very important." </p>
<p>Kim's well aware that it's witness intimidation to say these things with the suspect in question outside the door. </p>
<p>"I... I <em>suppose</em> I could have been mistaken," Ali says, distressed. "It could have been someone else. I didn't see... faces." </p>
<p>"What did you see?" </p>
<p>"I saw Armin, I'm sure. I know his voice. And the other man was bigger, and he had long hair. I thought I recognized him..."</p>
<p>"What was he wearing?" </p>
<p>"I don't remember. A jacket."</p>
<p>"Do you remember the color? Any pattern on it?"</p>
<p>"No, I don't think so."</p>
<p>"No white square or rectangle?" </p>
<p>"Not that I remember. No." Ali looks upset. "Didn't Claudine see it?"</p>
<p>"No. She only heard it."</p>
<p>"What about Harry? What does he say about it?"</p>
<p>"He doesn't remember this argument."</p>
<p>"But if he was drunk—"</p>
<p>"He wasn't." </p>
<p>Kim's not sure why he's defending Harry against the charges with more finality than Harry has defended himself, thus far. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">VOLTA DO MAR:</span> Perhaps because you've backed him, you've placed your trust in him, and now if he's wrong, you're wrong too? </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> But he <em>isn't</em> lying. I know he isn't. If he's wrong, he's just—wrong. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="int">LOGIC:</span> That might be worse. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="fys">SHIVERS:</span> <em>Holes... Holes in his brain...</em></p>
<p class="skill"><span class="int">DATA COLLECTOR:</span> Ali doesn't remember any symbols on the jacket. That's a good sign. It means it really <em>could</em> have been someone else. </p>
<p>Alexei straightens up, gripping the handkerchief in between his palms. "I know what I saw, officer. I saw two men having a drunken argument. It was about to turn violent. That's what I—heard. They were at each other’s throats. They were going to hurt each other. Over what—I don't know. I don't know."</p>
<p>Kim nods.</p>
<p>"Mr. Volya, can you think of any reason that anyone would want to harm Armin?" Kim asks.</p>
<p>"...He was an asshole?" </p>
<p>"Was he rude to you?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes," Alexei says, fixing his glasses. "Very."</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">VOLTA DO MAR:</span> (challenging—success) But he still liked him.</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">COMPASSION:</span><strong> </strong>Sometimes, that's how it is. </p>
<p>Outside, distant thunder rolls. The dreary afternoon rain is morphing into a proper nighttime storm. In Alexei the Anthropologist's room, none of the overhead lights are on; just the desk lamp and the floor lamp. It's the same ugly '30s style as the couch. Kim wonders whether that was when Claudine took over ownership. He wonders what she did before that. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="int">INTERPERSONAL ACUITY:</span> Time to go.</p>
<p>"Your testimony is very helpful, Alexei," Kim says, closing his notebook. "I'll let you get some sleep." </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="int">DATA COLLECTOR:</span> Often, it's after you close the notebook that they share the juiciest secrets. </p>
<p>They both stand, Alexei's chair creaking as it releases him. Kim's spine aches from the bony couch. Awkwardly, Alexei holds out his hand to shake Kim's.</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">VOLTA DO MAR:</span> Like he's studied the ways that men interact, and feels bound to enact them, even if it's not quite right for the situation. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="int">INTERPERSONAL ACUITY:</span> Cheers.</p>
<p>"Sorry for getting—weepy," Alexei says, studying Kim's shoulder as they shake hands. </p>
<p>"It's nothing to be ashamed of."</p>
<p>"It's hard being out here, isolated, away from home, for so long. You get lost in the work, you know?" </p>
<p>Kim, having no answer to that, pats him once on the shoulder.</p>
<p>Outside in the hall, the shadow moves and disappears. To unchain the door, Alexei has to close it briefly; as he does, Kim studies his back. He can see the outline of his undershirt beneath the white dress shirt, the seams shifting around his shoulderblades, tightening under his armpits. He reminds Kim of someone. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">BRAIN BOUNCER:</span> Don't think about this. Not right now. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">VOLTA DO MAR:</span> Pain. Deep, dull, tearing, ripping pain, like a bullet in the meat of your shoulder. </p>
<p>It shimmers through, psychosomatic. The pain is so sudden and intense he actually clenches his teeth and hisses, gripping his shoulder. He presses his thumb into the flesh. It hasn't bothered him all day, and now—</p>
<p>"Did you say something?" Alexei says, turning. He hasn't unlocked the door. </p>
<p>"No," Kim manages to say in a steady voice. They're standing close to each other now. In the low, blue light, Alexei can't see how pale his face has just gone. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="fys">VICE:</span> He's definitely looking. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">BRAIN BOUNCER:</span> (hard—success) I actually think this is an OK idea.</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="mot">VACATION KIM:</span> (easy—success) Me too.</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> No. Not professional. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="int">INTERPERSONAL ACUITY:</span> Get out of here, NOW. </p>
<p>If it wasn't for his shoulder, he might have thrown caution to the wind and followed his instincts. But it hurts too much. </p>
<p>"Just some pain in my shoulder," Kim says, looking down. "An old injury." </p>
<p>"Oh." </p>
<p>He can feel Ali's gaze still resting on him. Without looking up, Kim reaches past Ali's shoulder and unlocks the door. </p>
<p>The hallway is empty. Harry has disappeared. A tide of emotion washes over Kim before the mental door can lock it out; loneliness, shame, anger at himself, and dark despair. He feels inexplicably bitter towards Harry for leaving him alone with the witness, and an unexpected desire to see Bernadette, to have her warm, dark presence beside him, if nothing else. If nothing else. </p>
<p>Outside in the Dacha's courtyard, it's raining. It's dark as a cave; there are no lights, just the curtained backs of a few rooms. Kim stands under the awning, listening to the water rush out of the gutters and onto the cobblestone. On a night like this, at home, he'd go for a drive. Out here, he just lights a cigarette, and tries to think rationally. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="int">LOGIC:</span> You're acting emotionally. You're making decisions based on feelings. That's not good.</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> It's because you're acting outside the structure of the RCM. There's a reason you joined up, and stayed all these years, and it's not the exorbitant pay or the generous benefits package.</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">BRAIN BOUNCER:</span> You're acting this way because of <em>him. </em></p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> ...Him?</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="int">LOGIC:</span> (hard—failure) Harry?</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">BRAIN BOUNCER:</span> No. Him.</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="mot">VACATION KIM:</span> ...Who, me?</p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">BRAIN BOUNCER:</span> (hard—failure) Yes. You. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="mot">VACATION KIM:</span> Come on, man, I—</p>
<p>"Spare a light?" </p>
<p>Kim turns. It's Harry's voice. He can't make him out in the dark, but the voice came from the smoking area under the trellis, the one with the little wrought iron tables. Kim makes a picture in his mind. In it, Harry is soaking wet.</p>
<p>"Are you trying to get hypothermia out here, Detective?" </p>
<p>"No," Harry's voice says. "I'm showering. I thought you didn't smoke, Kim." </p>
<p>"Well," Kim replies vaguely. The wave of emotion has sapped his energy, leaving him too drained for conversational sparring. "I do."</p>
<p>He inhales deeply and exhales slowly. Nothing more comforting than that smell. Rain drips down off the awning, landing inches away from Kim's boots, and all over Harry.</p>
<p>"You aren't cold?" Kim says, once the nicotine has steadied him. </p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Mm." </p>
<p>Another pause. </p>
<p>"Do you want a light?" </p>
<p>The metal chair moves and Harry sloshes over. A chorus of rain accompanies the sound of Kim's lighter clinking. Flame lights up the dark, illuminating Harry's face in blurry orange. "I can't see your cigarette." The fog and droplets on Kim's glasses and the low light make visibility near zero. </p>
<p>"That's because I don't have one," Harry says. "Got a spare?"</p>
<p>"Pff," Kim laughs, letting the light go out. "Of course."</p>
<p>"They all got soaked."</p>
<p>"Here." Kim gives him one and lights it for him, and they smoke together under the awning. </p>
<p>"How'd it go with Alexei?"</p>
<p>"Fine." </p>
<p>"No surprises?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"So... Was this a successful day, Lieutenant? In your opinion?" </p>
<p>"Yes," Kim says, ignoring the faint tremor in his hand. With the hand not holding his cigarette, he holds his aching shoulder. In the dark, Harry can't see that. "All the parts of your alibi check out. And the witnesses who place you at that scene—both are inconclusive." </p>
<p>Another, stronger tremor shakes him. It's not the nicotine or the anxiety; it's the cold. His teeth chatter. </p>
<p>"Cold?"</p>
<p>Kim ignores the question. "I think your case is looking good, Detective."</p>
<p>"And tomorrow?" </p>
<p>"What about tomorrow?"</p>
<p>Harry's cigarette lights up as he takes a deep drag. "Are we going to continue the investigation?" </p>
<p>"The murder investigation?"</p>
<p>"Yeah." </p>
<p>"It's not our jurisdiction, Detective."</p>
<p>"I know."</p>
<p>"And we have no body." </p>
<p>"Yeah." </p>
<p>"And you are currently, in the mind of the local authorities, the lead suspect."</p>
<p>"Yes." A long, dramatic pause. "...And?"</p>
<p>Kim exhales another short laugh. He's too tired to hold his own in this conversation. </p>
<p>"<em>And</em>, Harry, it's not as simple as..."</p>
<p>"Mr. Kitsuragi! Mr. Kitsuragi!" </p>
<p>A voice is calling from across the courtyard—the direction of the barn. "Henri?" Harry calls into the dark. </p>
<p>"Mr. Du Bois—Where's Mr. Kitsuragi?" He can hear Henri splashing across the cobblestone courtyard at top speed. </p>
<p>"Right here!" </p>
<p>"What is it?" Kim says. </p>
<p>"It's your dog—" Henri says breathlessly in the dark. "She escaped!" </p>
<h3>*</h3>
<p>The wind that buffeted them all that day has swelled into a great tide, rolling over the cape and into the bay carrying a million tiny freezing drops of rain. Flashlights bounce off the mist and the droplets, creating an opaque tunnel wherever they point their light. Occasionally, they illuminate a tree—sparkling black bark, a patch of green moss—or a footprint in the mud—a paw print? But whose? Bernadette's, or the strays? </p>
<p>"Bernadette! Hey!" </p>
<p>"Bernadette! Bernie!" </p>
<p>Kim whistles, ungloved hand soaked, fingers freezing, lips freezing. </p>
<p>Near him, Harry's footsteps crunch over shells. They're somewhere near the beach, bayside. Harry is nothing more than a gray smudge of light to Kim. </p>
<p>"Anything?" he says. </p>
<p>Kim whistles again, long and hard.</p>
<p>They listen for the jingle of her collar. </p>
<p>They hear only the wind and the rain and the waves.</p>
<p>"Any idea <em>where</em> to look?" </p>
<p>Kim stands still, letting the wind flow around him. </p>
<p>"She'll come back," he says. "She can find her way back to the hostel."</p>
<p>"But it's unfamiliar territory. And rain interferes with smells. What if she can't?" </p>
<p>"She has a v—very good nose, Detective." Kim sneezes.</p>
<p>The smudge shaped like Harry sounds worried. "I think we should keep looking."</p>
<p>"She's probably hunting some small animal," Kim says. "She's probably having the time of her life." </p>
<p>"I don't think so," Harry says. "She's probably freezing cold, and lost, and scared."</p>
<p>"If that's the case—" Kim sneezes again. "If that's the case, then why didn't she come right back? She wanted to run away, Harry."</p>
<p>"You really think so?"</p>
<p>Steeling himself, Kim suppresses another sneeze. "Yes."</p>
<p>Harry the blurry cop says nothing for a moment. </p>
<p>Then he tramps off into the dark, inland.</p>
<p>"Harry—where are you going?"</p>
<p>"BERNADETTE!" he shouts. "COME HERE, GIRL! BERNIE!" </p>
<p>After another moment of hesitation, Kim jogs after him. </p>
<p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> He never stops. He never gives up. When Death comes for him, he'll stall 'til he finds a way out of it. </p>

<p class="skill"><span class="int">DATA COLLECTOR:</span> (easy—success) I do believe that is called "hypothermia." </p>
<p>Steep sandy bank. Muddy street. Broken oyster shells. Tree. Abandoned wheelbarrow full of shells. Cobblestone alley. White stone staircase. Muddy street. Kim's light illuminates a chain link fence and a single chicken, and he wonders whether they're passing the school. He has no idea where in Ifrania they are—he can hear the ocean, but he's not sure whether it's behind them or up ahead. </p>
<p>The lights of habitation become infrequent and the trees get thicker. Moss, hanging. Needles, green. Leaf mold, slick and brown beneath his boots. All the while, they yell and whistle, shining the flashlights into the haze. </p>
<p>Soon the roar of the ocean is ahead of them, louder than the wind. A broad arm strikes his chest unexpectedly. Stopping him. "What is it?" Kim whispers.</p>
<p>"Shh..."</p>
<p>They listen. Waves. Wind. Trees. Rain. And below that...</p>
<p>"Barking."</p>
<p>"That's her."</p>
<p>They take off down the slope. It's steep and rocky, and they can hear the ocean carving away at the beach, and the urgent "Woof-woof-woof" of Bernadette's warning bark, broadcasting her location like a signal flare. </p>
<p>Kim puts his fingers to his lips and whistles, long and sharp. The dog yips, then barks a few more times—more sedately. He fights his way through the fog and the scrub brush and over the driftwood to her.</p>
<p>"Hey—hey." Her fur is wet and gritty. She stops barking as soon as Kim touches her. She sits, then stands, tail wagging. "Hey, girl. Bad dog. You're a bad, bad dog, you know that? What is it? What's wrong?" </p>
<p>"Woof!"</p>
<p>Kim is kneeling in the pebbles, close to the breakers, stroking her head and scratching under her ears. Harry is clattering down behind him— "Did you find her?"</p>
<p>"Yes, right here," Kim says, and the flashlight turns towards him.</p>
<p>"Woof!"</p>
<p>"What is it?" Kim says again, like she can understand him. </p>
<p>"Holy shit," Harry says, right behind him. </p>
<p>"What?" </p>
<p>"Look."</p>
<p>Kim turns on his knees and looks where Harry's pointing the flashlight. His glasses are so fogged and flecked with water that he'd taken it for a driftwood log. But it's a corpse. </p>
<p>"Armin."</p>
<p>"Woof!"</p>
<p>Kim's heart is pounding. He nods slowly, looking at the blurry shape lying in the surf in the dark. It's so abstracted from a human form that he still doesn't register it as a person. "She found him," Harry says. "I can't believe it."</p>
<p>He turns the flashlight on Kim, and Kim looks up. Harry becomes nothing more than a broad-shouldered shadow behind the sun, but something clicks. </p>

    <h1 id="ch5">Chapter 5: Jamais-vu</h1>
<p>The street racing nightmare goes something like this. </p>

<p>He's driving in the RCGP, the "Revachol Circuit Grand Prix" or, as it was more affectionately known, the Jamrock Slam(rock). The Jamrock Slam, like all the street league races in Revachol, was completely unofficial and highly illegal; the RCM could do little about it without calling in the INSURCOM to shut it down by force, and there was of course no mayor or city government to pass preventative ordinances. The RCGP was the championship race, the culmination of the season. The best you could do about the league was pay attention to the flyers and stay off the circuit streets on the posted nights, when Revachol's tenuous, Coalition-enforced democracy gave way to total anarchy. </p>

<p>On these nights, the fans of the circuit league—the young and the old, the rich, the poor, and the dirt-poor, the Iilmaraan and Suruese and Samaran and Oranjese and Seolite alike—all of them united in their love for danger and drama, crowded together on the tops of walls and truckbeds to watch the race. There was food, and gambling, and drinking, and gambling, and tricked-out motor carriages, and gambling, and pirate radio coverage, and gambling. Eventually, when the RCM <em>did</em> root out league racing, they did so by shutting down the bookies one by one. </p>

<p>But that was still years away, now. </p>

<p>Young Kim Kitsuragi loved it all; had loved it since he discovered it in his early teens, while hanging around the auto body shop beneath his and his aunt's fifth apartment. The auto body shop employed a group of grungy, well-built older boys who slouched around smoking in grease-smeared jumpsuits, and whose every word and deed held a particular, mysterious interest for 13-year-old Kim. It wasn't until the boys introduced Kim to the circuit league that he truly fell in love.</p>

<p>Since age 15, he had been out of the crowd and behind the wheel. Most league drivers used stage names to race—for both dramatic flair and for legal protection. Kim, however, used no name at all. He was just Numéro 1111. His MC was no 1111. He wore all black. His MC was all black. It was a customized LUM Fevre GX-09—an old model, the same age as he was, in fact, with a supercharged, 8-cylinder NO2 injection engine, plus other dangerous modifications, all of it heavily subsidized by the shady sponsorships and fan donations that he received for being mysterious, daring, and very, very fast. </p>

<p>For years, this was his life—an escape from the frustration of school, the tedium of minimum-wage work, and later, the tedium of junior officership. The freedom, the adrenaline, the anonymity. Kim was good at it. Better than most. He liked that. He liked to win. He made it to RCGP five times, and won once, in '30. And he liked becoming someone else, behind the wheel, or maybe—as he secretly thought of it—becoming his true self, speed demon n° 1111. Not a person but a force, something that transcended physical limitations, that made decisions without emotion or reasoning but instead on instantaneous, infallible instinct. In his secret heart, he harbored dreams of TipTop Tournée. There were only a few racers from the Revacholian circuit league who had made it that far—not many, it was true, but maybe he could be the next. </p>

<p>In the dream, Kim is driving in his last race: the '32 Jamrock Slam. He is 23 years old. Outside, the night is dark. The GX is slicing down Delta Boulevard's main drag at 150 km/h. The radio burbles in his earpiece, inside the helmet. He's shrouded in black fireproof gear. He's in the driver's seat, but the steering levers, gearshift, gas, and brakes are all on the other side of the cabin, on the passenger side. </p>

<p>Sometimes, in the dream, the passenger seat is empty, and Kim's trying to slide over and steer, but he can't unbuckle his seat belt. Other times, someone else is in the driver's seat, but they can't do what Kim can do, and they want him to help, or else they reject his guidance. The GX, with a mind of its own, drives on, rocketing towards the 8/81 on-ramp without slowing down.</p>

<p><em>You need to slow down, 1-1, </em>says the radio dispatcher. </p>

<p><em>We need to slow down, </em>Kim says to the driver. <em>Slow down.</em></p>

<p><em>We need to slow down, </em>Kim says to the GX, when no one else is in the cabin.</p>

<p><em>We need to slow down, </em>he says to Bernadette, once, when the dream is different, and the dog is the one in the passenger seat. Kim is driving, but the brakes aren't responding. </p>

<p><em>"You need to slow down, 41," </em>the radio dispatcher said, in reality, in the Jamrock Slam of '32. </p>

<p>The 8/81 on-ramp hurtles towards him. In the pocket of grass embraced by the boulevard and the on-ramp and motorway, there is a makeshift grandstand for the truly insane. Scaffolding made out of laminawood and aluminum ferrule. If Kim can't slow down, the GX will skid right off the curve and kill every last one of them. </p>

<p>Sometimes, he's yelling so loud at his passenger that he wakes himself up. </p>

<p>Sometimes, he lunges so hard for the steering levers that he wakes himself up.</p>

<p>Sometimes, he can't stop it, and he hits the on-ramp doing 170 and rockets right off the inside wall, crashing into the stands. Splinters and metal and blood hit the glass and then he is in darkness, in incredible pain.</p>

<p>Sometimes, the dream takes the shape that reality did. In the '32 Jamrock Slam, he was flying along the Delta Boulevard Drag—the 75% mark of the race, nearing the climax, the Em-Jam Straight-shot on the 8/81—in a distant 5th. He had little hope of winning 1st place—he'd already accepted that his was a one-time victory—but he was bent on overtaking the racer currently in 4th, Numéro 41, because nº 41 was still close enough and nº 41 often made stupid strategic mistakes, and Kim was extremely good at focusing on achievable goals. </p>

<p>He was well aware this was probably his last Jamrock Slam, because he had decided to give up the TipTop dream and get serious about his career, and success in the illegal street racing circuit was not compatible with success as a law enforcement officer. He intended to go out with a bang. So, with the focus and precision that nº 1111 was known for, he was gaining on nº 41, his stupid green ForTex M, with its noisy suspension and its ugly dragon decal. The streetlights sped past like a train overhead as they raced down Delta towards the 8/81 on-ramp. </p>

<p>The on-ramp had a notoriously tight curve, and the deceleration required there took some skill. Instead of slowing down, the green ForTex pulled ahead with a burst of speed—Kim considered this unwise, so close to the turn-off, so Kim, giving up the overtake for now, stopped accelerating. <em>He</em> wasn't stupid. </p>

<p>But nº 41 was. In his haste to escape nº 1111's overtake, he hit the cement barrier head-on. The car careened off the wall and jackknifed across the track, spinning out. The fans in the little grandstand screamed. Kim decelerated the GX, hard. But the road was too narrow to pass, and he had too much momentum to stop. </p>

<p>His hands moved over levers, downshifting, as he braced himself against the back of his seat in preparation. Either he was going to just barely make it, passing nº 41 at exactly the right instant like a bird through a turbine, or they were going to collide, and his last race was going to end early and possibly in a lot of pain. </p>

<p>The ForTex was still spinning out, and he was slower, in control, he was counting the rhythm with his unreliable eyes and his reliable timing. </p>

<p>Kim accelerated.</p>

<p>He would have made it, he later concluded, and witnesses agreed. He would have made it, if it hadn't been for the tire. </p>

<p>In its death spiral, nº 41 threw off ballast—the left rear tire came loose, and flew under Kim's front wheels. The GX went into a spin, the tire slid under the carriage, and nº 1111 flipped into the air and crash landed in a far more spectacular manner than nº 41. </p>

<p>Kim doesn't remember the moment of impact, but he does remember flying upside-down through the air, all his weight compressed on his shoulders and neck and all the fear leaving his body like it was flung out by centrifugal force. Chasing the danger means catching it sometimes. He accepted all the consequences. He felt the peace of powerlessness. Then the chassis hit the pavement with a deafening <em>boom</em>, louder than an air raid, and skidded some ways up the on-ramp. Everything was broken; Kim couldn't hear or understand any sounds, and he could hardly see anything, and he couldn't feel anything, anywhere. The fear came rushing back. <em>What if I've been paralyzed? What if I can never drive again? What if I'm dead? </em></p>

<p>The first sensation to return was smell. He smelled fuel. </p>

<p>Then he felt heat. </p>

<p>Fire.</p>

<p>This was a reason to move, his reasoning supplied. His peripheral nervous system, however, was still not picking up the receiver. </p>

<p><em>The GX</em>, he thought sadly, feeling his first non-fear emotion. It was probably destroyed. He patted it. </p>

<p>
  <em>Your hand works! </em>
</p>

<p>This was good news.</p>

<p>With some difficulty, he unbuckled his seatbelt. This was difficult because he was still upside-down, and the pressure on the buckle was enormous. <em>Click</em>. He fell. </p>

<p>Kim still didn't have his bearings, and could still not hear. If he had been able to hear, he would have heard the screaming, and the sirens, and the fire, which had already started in his engine and was making a rapid approach Kimwise. Where he was, it was dark, and cramped. He wanted to get out, into the orange-lit world, but he couldn't contort his body into the right shape to exit from this dark space. His legs also felt very, very hot. </p>

<p>Then, the miracle occurred. A force connected with the fire-proof scruff of his protective black jumpsuit, and pulled. </p>

<p>It dragged him out through the narrow opening, over the twisted metal of his trusty Lum Fevre GX, and onto hard black pavement. And the miraculous force didn't stop there. It dragged him over the pavement—pain bloomed in his leg, deep and sharp, worse than anything that had come before—and away, and then the miraculous force rolled him onto his back and checked his breathing with steady hands on his chest. </p>

<p>In his peripheral vision, a bonfire burst to life. </p>

<p>Strong arms lifted him up. A mouth moved but he couldn't hear the voice. The colorful emergency lights grew closer. Later, he would ask after his rescuer—it wasn't one of the medics, it was a bystander from the audience, from the dangerous little grandstand at the corner of the 8/81 on-ramp. The medics told him that his MC had been consumed by flames seconds after he'd been pulled out. The bystander had saved Kim's life. While pulling him out over the twisted metal chassis, he had also given Kim a nasty wound on his upper thigh. That, not the shock or concussion or first-degree burns, was what kept Kim in the hospital for a week, and ended his racing career. The nerve damage made his reaction time slightly slower in his right leg. </p>

<p>Ever since that night, Kim has had recurring dreams of the crash. Sometimes he can't prevent it. Sometimes it's caused by his uninformed passenger. Sometimes, he is the rescuer, running towards the ruined GX as the fire catches in the engine, but in those dreams, he can never make it fast enough—the fire blooms, consuming its victim before Kim can rescue him, whoever he is. Lately, it's that version of the dream that comes almost every night. </p>

<p>That was almost 20 years ago. Kim has cheated death once more since then. He's never known who his rescuer was, or harbored any hope of finding out; his memory is too fuzzy and fragmented—arms and half a face, if that. </p>

<p>But looking up at Harry on the beach in the dark, Kim realizes he's found him. The person who rescued him from his wrecked MC in the '32 Jamrock Slam was Harry Du Bois.  </p>

<h3>*</h3>

<h2>Day 4 - 9:52 P.M.</h2>

<p>Back on the beach, in the whining wind and icy rain, Harry doesn't notice that Kim has suddenly gone rigid and silent. </p>

<p class="skill"><span class="mot">KINETIC DRESSAGE:</span> (easy—success) That's pretty much how I am all the time.</p>

<p>Harry the bear cop has his eyes on the half-frozen corpse. Kim's still staring at him. "Do you think we can carry him back to civilization?" Harry says. </p>

<p>When Kim doesn't reply, Harry looks at him again. </p>

<p>"You okay, Kim?" </p>

<p>Roused by the sound of his own name, Kim buys himself time by fishing out a dry handkerchief and cleaning off his glasses. Back in visual focus for the first time, Harry looks like a drenched cat. He doesn't appear to be cold at all. Kim is freezing.</p>

<p>"Fine," Kim says.</p>

<p class="skill"><span class="psy">BRAIN BOUNCER:</span> Obviously, we can say nothing of what we just learned.</p>

<p class="skill"><span class="fys">SPEED DEMON Nº 1111:</span> Whaaaaat? Come on!</p>

<p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> So, he saved your life. That's great. You'd save his, too. You're officers of the RCM. You're brothers-in-arms. You'll return the favor—ASAP, in fact. </p>

<p class="choice">
  <strong>➤ Task Gained: Save Harry Du Bois's Life.</strong>
</p>

<p class="skill"><span class="fys">SPEED DEMON Nº 1111:</span> We need to talk to him about this. You can bond over it! Come on, he'll love it! And you love telling people about me! Especially people who you know will appreciate it! </p>

<p class="skill"><span class="mot">TORQUE DORK:</span> And he <em>obviously</em> will, darling. He was at the Jamrock Slam, sitting in one of the most <em>dangerous </em>seats in the circuit. He was a thrill-seeker, a true <em>devotee </em>of the league. Maybe even a devotee of <em>yours</em>. </p>

<p class="skill"><span class="fys">ENDURANCE:</span> The answer to his question, by the way, is no. His first question.</p>

<p>"We can't carry him back," Kim says. "I can't."</p>

<p>He indicates his shoulder. </p>

<p>"I have an injury."</p>

<p>"Oh," Harry says. "You could have fooled me." He looks around with his flashlight. They're at the base of a ridge, a steep slope of sand and rock and scrub. Coming down was easy; going back up won't be. </p>

<p>The beach is a boneyard of bleached wood, from what little they can see, a blip between two tall sea stacks. Kim remembers the spot from his long walk home the morning before (<em>Was it really only yesterday?</em>), and he remembers that one of the cliffs has an arch under it. With difficulty, they drag Armin's body south, towards the shelter under the rock. Bernadette follows, very interested in the plank-like corpse. </p>

<p>Under the narrow tunnel of rock, they rest the frozen corpse on the pebbly ground. It's less like standing in a cave and more like standing under a bridge. Kim, gloved hands trembling with cold, tucks his flashlight into his shoulder like a telephone receiver, and takes out his notebook to begin the field autopsy. </p>

<p>The body has been in a deep freeze for the last 36-odd hours, drifting on salty currents just above freezing. It hardly looks human; it looks like a lump of rock. The color is gone from the flesh and the clothes, leaving it uniformly gray, crusted with ice and stained with salt. </p>

<p>Harry kneels over the body, flashlight in his mouth. No rubber gloves. It's his first encounter with the corpse, so Kim, shivering inside his leather jacket, gives them time getting acquainted. He writes down all the necessary categories for the autopsy. </p>

<p>"Cause of death?" Harry finally says, breaking the loud silence. With a ghostly, naked hand, he points to the ghastly hole in Armin's cheek. </p>

<p>"My conclusion," Kim says. </p>

<p>Harry leans in close to Armin's frozen face, pointing the flashlight straight into the hole. He doesn't even grimace. </p>

<p class="skill"> <span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> (easy—success) He's seen worse.</p>

<p class="skill"><span class="fys">SHIVERS:</span> (medium—success) Much worse.</p>

<p>"What was it?" Harry says. He looks up at Kim from the rocky ground. "What weapon can make a wound like this?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>Harry touches it. Kim's stomach lurches. </p>

<p>"Frozen," Harry says. "But smooth. Feels like... frozen meat."</p>

<p>"I'll write that d—down, shall I?" Kim says, failing to control his jaw.</p>

<p>Harry looks up. "You cold, Kim?"</p>

<p>"Let's just do this as quickly as we can. I've already done the initial examination. There won't be much—more left that the ocean hasn't washed away."</p>

<p>Harry goes back to the entry wound. He peers down into it. "When you found him, was there much blood?" He's still rubbing his finger around the rim of the void. </p>

<p>"No. Just a small amount on the back of the head. Congealed."</p>

<p>"And it wasn't because the water washed it away."</p>

<p>"No." </p>

<p>"Self-cauterizing wound," Harry says. </p>

<p>Kim nods. "Mhm."</p>

<p>"Something hot." </p>

<p>Kim nods again. "Or else, it wasn't the cause of death. Perhaps he was killed by something we can't see yet, and this is just treatment."</p>

<p>"Lividity on the brain—would that tell us if he was still alive when it was made?"</p>

<p>"Presumably, if you could make it out, Detective. Your eyes are better than mine, but these are not ideal c—conditions." </p>

<p>Harry takes Armin's frozen corpse into his arms and hoists it up onto his knees, leaning, if possible, even closer. In what Kim considers perhaps a stroke of investigative genius, Harry points the flashlight up the exit wound, into the tunnel through Armin's once-functional brain. He closes one eye and peers in, leaning so close that his ruddy, living nose touches Armin's purple, permanently broken one.</p>

<p>The light shining through makes a circle around Harry's eye. Kim watches with a mix of horror and awe. </p>

<p>"Red and brown," Harry says, voice muffled. "Bruising. There's burst blood vessels in his brain. I can see them." </p>

<p class="notebook">
  <em>Face/head wound: burst blood vessels in brain tissue. Evidence that hole was pierced while victim was alive.</em>
</p>

<p>Harry lets go of Armin's cold shoulder and puts his index finger into the exit wound at the back of his skull. With his other hand, he sticks the flashlight into his mouth. Thoughtfully, he runs his finger around the edge of the wound, then his thumb around the rim. </p>

<p class="skill"><span class="fys">VICE:</span> What... is going on here?</p>

<p>"The skull," Harry says. "It's..."</p>

<p>"Jagged or smooth?" </p>

<p>"I can feel small fractures," Harry says. "Whatever it was, it was pushed in with a lot of force." </p>

<p class="notebook">
  <em>Exit wound: Fractures. Traumatic force.</em>
</p>

<p>"What about the entry wound?" </p>

<p>"You think this is the exit wound?" Harry says, looking up at him with his finger in the bottom of the wound and his flashlight between his teeth like a cigar. </p>

<p>"That is the assumption I have been operating under, yes," Kim replies, stiffly. "Perhaps we should find a way to confirm that." </p>

<p>Harry nods. He puts the flashlight back underneath the hole and feels around the top again with his other hand. Kim watches him shut his eyes and tip his head back, lips parted in concentration, as he circles the frozen rim of the wound. His finger dips inside, then further in, sliding back and forth—it's not a perfect circle, it's elliptical, almost like a keyhole. He withdraws his finger again and explores the shape, then quickly, opening his eyes and moving the flashlight, he feels at the back again. </p>

<p>"It's... non-uniform," Harry says. "What's the word... wider at the top and bottom."</p>

<p>Kim's voice comes out dry: "Tapered?" </p>

<p>"Yes—yeah. It's tapered at both ends. Like an hourglass. I... can't tell... how narrow it gets in the middle..." He frowns in frustration, trying to thrust his finger deeper.</p>

<p>"Don't force it, Detective." </p>

<p>"Do you want to try?" Harry asks, looking up. </p>

<p>"No, I do not," Kim says. The idea of looking into that void of darkness and death again—even and perhaps especially in the current circumstances—sickens him. </p>

<p>Harry nods, still digging up and in with his index finger. Kim finally looks away, up at the ceiling of the cave. </p>

<p>"Sorry," Harry says, "is this too gross?" </p>

<p>"...Can you feel anything in there? Any other—material?"</p>

<p>"No," Harry says. "Just brain. And I think it's starting to thaw out from my body heat. Eugh." He pulls his finger out with a slick sound that Kim wishes he hadn't heard. </p>

<p>Silently, Kim hands him a handkerchief. Harry wipes off his finger and thumb, rubbing the feeling back into his cold fingertips. Outside, the waves crash against the rocks. Kim remembers he's cold, too. </p>

<p>In the notebook, he makes note of the hourglass-shaped wound.</p>

<p>"What's your conclusion regarding entry and exit points, Detective?" Kim asks, not looking up again. </p>

<p>"I think your initial instinct was right," Harry says. He can tell from Harry's voice that he's touching it again. "There's no fracturing on the cheekbone. It's a smooth perforation. It went in this way. Like I said—a huge amount of force."</p>

<p>Kim makes note. </p>

<p>"So in your initial external exam, you found no other evidence of injury, that right?" Harry asks, setting Armin's body back on the ground. He starts unbuttoning the white collared shirt. </p>

<p>"That's right."</p>

<p>"Okay. Are you ready?" </p>

<p>Kim clicks his pen in response. "Go ahead." </p>

<p>"Decomposition has been arrested by the cold temperature of the ocean. Clothing shows salt damage and some predation on exposed extremities by fish. One sleeve of jacket is missing... One button missing as well." He pulls the shirt apart, exposing the frozen white chest. The fabric is stiff with ice. "A lot of bruising... postmortem... based on the pattern." He's running his big hands slowly and lightly over the marbled purple and blue on the dead man's torso. "Except... here." He follows something up, a trail that only he can see, up the sternum, between the pectorals, tracing his neck and throat, and up to his chin. Back to his face. "Yellow... brown. Broken nose is the same color. There is some bruising here that was made while the body was still warm. Or at least, before the deep-sea freeze." </p>

<p>"Consistent with dragging?"</p>

<p>"Yeah. That's what I was thinking."</p>

<p>"That's consistent with the mud and crease marks I found in my initial exam." </p>

<p>"Good."</p>

<p>Kim records Harry's words in shorthand. He glances up again to see Harry hand cupping Armin's chin. He's trying to open his mouth, Kim realizes. Harry rubs his thumb back and forth over the bloodless lips, trying to generate a little heat. "Did you open his mouth?" Harry asks. </p>

<p>Kim shakes his head. </p>

<p>Harry leans in and breathes warm air onto the dead man's mouth. Kim watches with raised eyebrows.</p>

<p class="skill"><span class="int">CONCEPTUALIZATION:</span> (challenging—success) He's completely unfazed by death. Intimate with it, even. </p>

<p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> It's...</p>

<p>Harry massages his jaw on both sides, then leans down and exhales again, his breath making a little steam against the frozen surface of Armin's lips. He digs his fingers in and pries downward. The frozen flesh yields, and his mouth opens. </p>

<p>"Respiratory..." </p>

<p>There's a <em>crack </em>of bone. Kim starts. </p>

<p>"Shit," Harry says. "Too far." </p>

<p class="skill"><span class="psy">BRAIN BOUNCER:</span> Focus.</p>

<p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> Take notes!</p>

<p>"...Respiratory." Harry feels the chest and ribs again, pressing harder this time with a flat hand. He points the flashlight into Armin's unnaturally open mouth, frowning. "Hard to tell. No evidence of choking, no evidence of suffocation on the inside of the mouth." </p>

<p>Kim silently records the prognosis. </p>

<p>"Hepatobiliary... Toxicology... Serology... can't be assessed by this examiner," Harry continues, still pressing on the chest and ribs. He massages the stomach, which is just as frozen as the rest of him. "Gastrointestinal... Undetermined, in the conditions. Cardiovascular... No blood anywhere."</p>

<p>"There was hardly any when I found him," Kim repeats. </p>

<p>"We can't rule out poison," Harry says. "He could have been poisoned before this was made." He taps at the cheek, below the entry wound. </p>

<p class="skill"><span class="int">LOGIC:</span> That doesn't really matter. This was obviously the killing blow, and identifying the weapon that caused it will be much easier—and also more crucial to public safety—than looking for a ghost poison. </p>

<p>"My conclusion was that that wound was the cause of death," Kim says. "After your examination, do you concur?" </p>

<p>Harry looks back down at his victim's face, lying in his lap with sightless eyes and a broken-open jaw. </p>

<p class="skill"><span class="int">DATA COLLECTOR:</span><strong> </strong>He thinks there's still something else left for him to find. </p>

<p>He runs a hand up the center of Armin's face, feeling his nose. There's a purple and brown bruise at the bridge, a later stage of the same bruise that Kim noticed the day before. "Nose broken, post-mortem," Kim comments.</p>

<p>"While being dragged..." </p>

<p>"No blood on his clothing from that."</p>

<p>"Face down, then." </p>

<p>Harry's hand circles the broken nose lightly, then travels over the forehead. He strokes Armin's left eyelid, inches above the face wound. "It's like glass..."</p>

<p>Then something happens. The fogged gray pupil moves. The eye looks at Harry. </p>

<p>Harry yelps and yanks his hand back. Kim jumps in shock, then drops to his knees beside the body, dropping his notebook—"Did you see that?" </p>

<p>"It looked like he moved his eye. But that's—"</p>

<p>"Impossible." Kim's heart is thumping, adrenaline already fading. For a second there, his hands had prepared to perform CPR, but his rational mind is catching up.</p>

<p class="skill"><span class="int">LOGIC:</span> (trivial—success) It was an optical illusion. </p>

<p>"That's impossible," Kim restates. Nonetheless, he presses two fingers against Armin's throat. His flesh is ice cold, with only the slightest give—'frozen meat' is right. He's dead. </p>

<p>Harry leans in close again, shining the flashlight into Armin's ice-fogged eyes as Kim puts his glove back on. He rests his hand on Armin's chest. "Hold this—would you?" Harry says. </p>

<p>Kim takes his flashlight. Harry starts pressing around Armin's eyes with both thumbs, like he's looking for a secret catch or button. </p>

<p>"He's not alive, Harry," Kim murmurs. "It was an optical illusion. A trick of the light." </p>

<p>Harry looks back up at Kim, inches away. His warm breath makes a cloud between them, fogs Kim's glasses. "That's one possibility," he says.</p>

<p>"There <em>is </em>no other possibility," Kim replies in a low voice. </p>

<p>Harry quirks an eyebrow. </p>

<p>"If you're suggesting a supranatural explanation, Detective..." Kim raises both eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Think about where we are right now, Lieutenant."</p>

<p>"You mean la zone d'émergence?" </p>

<p>Harry nods. "Bernie brought us to the eastern side of the cape. And... Armin's body has been floating on ocean currents all day that could have sent him as far out as porch collapse."</p>

<p>"That's over 50 kilometers," Kim says. "100 round trip. That's not possible in a single day."</p>

<p>"Pale exposure can do crazy things, Kim," Harry insists. "Why not this?"</p>

<p>"'Why not' reanimate the dead?" Kim says dryly. "Because it's a biological impossibility, that's why not." </p>

<p>Harry is undaunted. He just smiles, exhaling another warm cloud of fog. "What about time displacement?" </p>

<p class="skill"><span class="fys">SHIVERS:</span> (medium—success) That rings much truer. So much so that it gives you a chill.</p>

<p>At close rage, Harry the bear cop has a disarming smile. It's hard to look away from it. His mouth is warm red and slightly open. "There's no recorded proof of Pale-influenced time displacement for anything other than electromagnetic signals," Kim hears himself say, firmly. "What you're describing is superstition." </p>

<p>"Then tell me you didn't see it too."</p>

<p>"I saw it," says Kim, looking away. "It was a trick of the light." </p>

<h3>*</h3>

<p>Night is as dense and dark around them as a shroud, and Kim moves through it like a ghost, feeling connected to nothing. His psyche and his body are losing touch with each other, communicating through increasing interference. It's so late at night that he's transcended tiredness. He's so cold that he's forgotten he's freezing. He can hardly see more than a few feet ahead, and can hardly hear anything over the roar of the waves. Harry and Kim move the corpse, heavy with frozen water, up past the waterline, onto an embankment where small trees grow. Harry and the Constable will return with help tomorrow to retrieve it. They consider taking the same shortcut by which they came—thrashing straight through the woods over the cliffs—but in the end Kim deems it too risky in the dark. He and the dog know the marked route, and they know it will take at least 3 hours. </p>

<p>They walk. They had not dressed for an excursion like this. Kim has two layers of wool socks, and his leather jacket, though heavy, keeps him warm. Harry is not so lucky: cotton shirt, cotton socks, and thin, flat-soled, ugly shoes. He complains, then the complaints fade to silence. They can see nothing beyond their small sphere of light, illuminating the stones and driftwood underfoot, and they can hear nothing but the ocean on their left, invisible. </p>

<p class="notebook">Good. Now, listen. I know your conceptualization skills are rudimentary—you're more of a logic guy, Kim, I get that. You like cause and effect. You like <strong>proof</strong>. So this might be hard. But I'm going to need you to try, OK? </p>

<p class="notebook">In that cave, you saw a dead man's eye move. Yesterday, the lividity on his corpse was not temporally consistent. It's starting to occur to you that there might be more to this case than meets the—euh, rigidities of conventional wisdom. <strong>Not</strong> because the supranatural is real (god, no), but because we (humanity) are still in the early stages of understanding the Pale <strong>as</strong> a phenomenon. That our understanding is limited does not mean its phenomena are not actual, and affecting the physical world in real ways, every day. You're going to need to wrap your head at least partway around that. </p>

<p class="notebook">And plus, Harrier will appreciate it if you do. </p>

<p class="notebook">So? What about it?</p>

  <em>-1 to Data Collector: Overinterpreting non-objective evidence.</em>
</p>

<p class="skill"><span class="int">CONCEPTUALIZATION:</span> Let's think over what you read about Palestorms in your cute little Guide Gris, shall we? It was the sterilized version, for the Occidental tourists. </p>

<p class="notebook">GUIDE GRIS "THE NATURAL WONDERS OF LE CAILLOU AND SURROUNDING ARCHIPELAGOS": 4th EDITION: <em>Palestorms are exceedingly rare, and the seasoned traveler should be no more concerned about them than they should be about sandstorms in the Koko Nur or snow in the Irmalan Mountains. </em></p>

<p class="notebook">
  <em>Because they are so poorly understood, their arrival cannot be predicted by more than a few hours. Local authorities will announce any danger, and shelter can be taken underground. In Ifrania-du-roi, the former military retreat is outfitted with its very own plumb-plated, storm-proof bunker. Locals always have protective masks on hand to share with those who do not have their own. In a pinch, bandanas and scarves work too. </em>
</p>

<p class="skill"><span class="int">DATA COLLECTOR:</span> "Poorly understood" in the '80s. 70 years later, it's better understood. They can predict them with some accuracy, a few days in advance. They've also shown that covering your face with fabric does absolutely nothing to protect you from it.</p>

<p class="skill"><span class="int">LOGIC:</span> Protect me from <em>what</em>?  </p>

<p>An owl hoots nearby, startling both men. They're in the forest now, past the abandoned campsite, walking inland through the pines. </p>

<p class="skill"><span class="fys">SHIVERS:</span> (hard—success) They say that when Palestorms roll inland, navigation becomes as impossible as traversing the ocean without stars or compass; streets that had once been familiar become spatially alien, leading you in loops; rooms in your home become temporally unreliable—long-dead family members can be seen cooking in the kitchen or sleeping on the couch; even the air itself becomes untrustworthy, molecules of different gasses rearranging themselves into clouds like they've forgotten about entropy and gained intentions of their own. </p>

<p class="skill"><span class="psy">VOLTA DO MAR:</span> Part of me is healthily afraid of this phenomenon, like a sensible person who does not want to fly, because both man's feet belong on solid ground. But another part of me, the part that always longed to be a pilot, feels curious to see it, to experience the indescribable. </p>

<p class="skill"><span class="fys">SPEED DEMON Nº 1111:</span> Fuck yeah. </p>

<p class="skill"><span class="psy">BRAIN BOUNCER:</span> (hard—failure) But <em>not </em>if it means I will wake up, or have any awareness or motor function whatsoever, after I <em>die</em>. That is <em>horrifying. </em></p>

<p class="skill"><span class="int">CONCEPTUALIZATION:</span> (challenging—success) Could Armin's exposure to l'émergence have displaced him, even partially, in time?</p>

<p>Kim tries to imagine it, to make it fit with what he knows of the world. He can't. But he tries. </p>

<p class="skill"><span class="fys">SHIVERS:</span> (hard—success) In your psyche, a lot of large, intangible things are rearranging themselves. You feel unreal, this late at night, in a dark and unfamiliar place, alongside an unfamiliar companion and someone else's dog. Outside your will or control, your mind is working differently, reshaping itself. In the morning, these changes will fade from your awareness. But you'll have learned something new about yourself, which you didn't think was still possible at this age. You think of yourself as someone rigid and intentional; you think that you know yourself quite well. Your capacity for change might surprise you. </p>

<p>By the time they get back to town, it's closer to dawn than to midnight. The streets are silent, and even the rain feels quieter, a uniform hiss of water over the muddy ground and the eternite roofs. The world is so quiet it feels made-up. In his exhausted state, Kim desires warmth and unconsciousness. </p>

<p class="skill"><span class="psy">BRAIN BOUNCER:</span> No dreams, tonight, please. </p>

<p class="skill"><span class="fys">SHIVERS:</span> (hard—failure) We'll see about that.</p>

<p>Harry, close beside him, has maintained a pretty good pace for a recovering alcoholic. His lungs wheeze in a steady way that suggests they might actually appreciate the strain. The flashlight batteries have long since died. </p>

<p>"Think it's unlocked?" </p>

<p>Harry accompanies them unquestioningly to the stables, like the safe return of Bernadette is just as much his responsibility as Kim's. They sneak around the back of the Dacha like teenagers out past curfew. The doors are bolted, so Kim has to climb in through a window. There, he makes an interesting discovery—the antique green Lebewesen Model H, parked inside a stall, a silhouette in the dark. He lets Harry and Bernadette inside. Harry finds a chain-link crosstie on the wall and clips the dog up with that—"Good luck chewing through that, Bernie," he mutters to her, and she sniffs his face and licks his cheek. Kim silently bids her good night, and the two men steal across the courtyard. </p>

<p>Water rushes from the gutters. The clouded night sky is a light gray square above the Dacha's black walls. "Time for bed," Kim mutters. "I don't think I remember what it feels like to be warm and dry."</p>

<p>Harry grunts. They reach the back door.</p>

<p>He jiggles the handle while Kim wipes off his glasses. The hallway lights are off inside. </p>

<p>"I hope I actually—sleep," Harry mutters. </p>

<p>"You'll sleep," Kim says. "Your body needs rest. It's been a very long day."</p>

<p>"It's not my body that's the problem," Harry says, opening the door. His shadowy arm gestures for Kim to step inside first. "It's my brain." </p>

<p>"Take a warm shower," Kim says, wiping his boots off. The hall is carpeted and narrow, and he remembers the layout in the dark. "Don't turn the lights on."</p>

<p>"You make it sound so simple."</p>

<p>"It is simple, Detective." </p>

<p class="skill"><span class="psy">ESPRIT DE CORPS:</span> (easy—success) Once asleep, he'll probably just have the same problem as you—nightmares. </p>

<p>Harry walks Kim to his room, for some reason. Kim is ready to pass out on his feet. At his door, he pats Harry on the arm. "Good work tonight. Thank you for helping me search for the dog." </p>

<p>"Sure thing, Kim. G'night."</p>

<p>"Good night, Harry."</p>

<p>Kim closes the door on the sound of Harry's shuffling footsteps, with the warm, wan friendliness of his voice lingering in his ears. He thinks of the '32 Jamrock Slam. Despite his exhaustion, Kim crawls into bed with a strange feeling of buoyancy; it's a feeling he remembers from when he was a child, when he acquired a new, precious object, and could hardly fall asleep for the excitement of waking up tomorrow. A feeling of discovery and newness. </p>
